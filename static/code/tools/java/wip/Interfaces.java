// an interface is an abstract type that is used to specify behavior that classes must implement


	// an interface may not define any instance fields thought it can include constants that are declared both static and final





// interfaces cannot be instantiated but object reference may be specified to be of an interface type in which case they can be bound to an object that implements the interface




// interfaces can contain method signatures without method bodies

	// all non-default methods of an interface are implicitly abstract and public so the keywords are usually omitted

// interfaces may extend other interfaces, and, like a class definition, an interface definition indicates this by including an extends clause

// when one interface extends another, it inherits all the methods and constants of its superinterface and can define new methods and constants

// the extends clause of an interface definition may include more than one superinterface

// a class uses implements to name one or more interfaces it implements

// if a class implements an interface but does not provide an implementation for every mandatory interface method, it inherits those unimplemented abstract methods from the interface and must be declared abstract

// Interfaces are data types in Java, just like classes. When a class implements an interface, instances of that class can be assigned to variables of the interface type.


// DEFAULT METHODS

// a default method can be added to any interface and must include an implementation

// an implementing class may (but is not required to) implement the default method

// if an implementing class implements the default method, then the implementation in the class is used; otherwise, the default implementation is used

// one consequence of default methods is that when implementing multiple interfaces, itâ€™s possible that two or more interfaces may contain a default method with a completely identical name and signature

 default void call() {
 System.out.println("Hello!");
 }
}

interface Caller {
 default void call() {
 Switchboard.placeCall(this);
 }

public class Person implements Vocal, Caller {
 // ... which default is used?
}

// If a class implements multiple interfaces in such a way as to cause a potential clash of default method implementations, the implementing class must override the clashing method and provide a definition of what is to be done.

// syntax is provided to allow the implementing class to simply call one of the interface default methods if that is what is required

public class Person implements Vocal, Caller {
 public void call() {
 // Can do our own thing
 // or delegate to either interface
 // e.g.,
 // Vocal.super.call();
 // or
 // Caller.super.call();
 }
}


// a default method can call another method on the interface, call any static method and use the this reference


// all interfaces are abstract and the modifier is optional in interface declarations

// a final class cannot be subclassed

// a final method cannot be overridden

// a final field cannot have its value changed; static final fields are compile-time constants

// a static inner class is a top-level class and is not associated with a member of the containing class
