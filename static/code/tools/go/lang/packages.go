there is a global Go rule that also applies to
function and variable names and is valid for all packages except main: everything
that begins with a lowercase letter is considered private and is accessible in the
current package only. 


Go programs are organized in packages

The package keyword helps you define the name of a new package

if you are
creating an executable application and not just a package that will be shared by other
applications or packages, you should name your package main

The import keyword is used for importing other Go packages in your Go programs
in order to use some or all of their functionality

external packages are imported using their full internet paths
