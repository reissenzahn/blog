Abstract classesï»¿
A class may be declared abstract, along with some or all of its members. An abstract member does not have an implementation in its class. You don't need to annotate abstract classes or functions with open.

abstract class Polygon {
    abstract fun draw()
}

class Rectangle : Polygon() {
    override fun draw() {
        // draw the rectangle
    }
}
Copied!
You can override a non-abstract open member with an abstract one.

open class Polygon {
    open fun draw() {
        // some default polygon drawing method
    }
}

abstract class WildShape : Polygon() {
    // Classes that inherit WildShape need to provide their own
    // draw method instead of using the default on Polygon
    abstract override fun draw()
}
