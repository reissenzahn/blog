## Trie

A trie is a tree data structure that is used to store a set of keys. Typically, these keys will consist of strings and the nodes of the tree will store the individual characters of these strings. Accessing a key is performed by traversing the tree from the root node by following the links between nodes which correspond to the characters in the key.
