<p>
  Depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm which explores a graph to find every vertex reachable from a starting vertex. The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly exploring an unvisited vertex adjacent to the current vertex. This continues until a dead-end is reached at which point the algorithm backtracks until it finds an unvisited vertex to explore. This process is repeated until the algorithm backtracks past the source vertex.
</p>

<p>
  Given a graph \(G = (V,E)\) and a starting vertex, depth-first search proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize an empty stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark the source vertex as visited and push it onto the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pop a vertex off the stack and consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a vertex adjacent to the popped vertex has not been visited then mark it as visited and push it onto the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 3-4 until the stack is empty.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Alternatively, depth-first search lends itself to a recursive implementation:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Mark the current vertex as visited.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an adjacent vertex has not been visited then recurse with that vertex.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Depth-first search has worst-case performance of \(O(|V| + |E|)\) and worst-case space complexity of \(O(|V|)\).
</p>

<p>This has time complexity O(n + m) where the graph has n vertices and m edges.</p>
