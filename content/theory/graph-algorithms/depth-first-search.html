<p>
  Depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm which explores a graph to find every vertex reachable from a starting vertex. The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly exploring an unvisited vertex adjacent to the current vertex. This continues until a dead-end is reached at which point the algorithm backtracks until it finds an unvisited vertex to explore. This process is repeated until the algorithm backtracks past the source vertex.
</p>


<h3>Recursive Approach</h3>

<p>
  Depth-first search lends itself to an intuitive recursive implementation:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Mark the current vertex as visited.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    For each adjacent vertex, if that vertex has not been visited then recurse with that vertex.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Above we start at A and explore B, C, D, G, L and P. We then backtrack to L and explore H. We backtrack to G and explore J, I, E and F. Again, we backtrack to I after which we explore M, N, K and O before backtracking back to A.
</p>


<h3>Iterative Approach</h3>

<p>
  Depth-first search can be implemented iteratively using a stack. We start by marking the source vertex as visited and push it onto the stack. We then pop a vertex off the stack and consider each of its adjacent vertices. If a vertex adjacent to the popped vertex has not been visited then mark it as visited and push it onto the stack. We repeat this until the stack is empty.

<h3>Complexity</h3>

<p>This has worst-case time complexity of O(n + m) where the graph has n vertices and m edges. The worst-case space complexity is O(n).</p>
