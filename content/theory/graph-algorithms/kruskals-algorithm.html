<p>
  Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected it finds a minimum spanning tree. This minimum spanning tree consists of a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
</p>

<p>We initialize a union-find of the set of vertices and proceed as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Sort edges by ascending edge weight.
  </li>
  <li>
    Step over each of the sorted edges and inspect the incident vertices. If the vertices have been unified then do not include this edge; otherwise, include the edge and unify the vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this until either every edge has been processed or all the vertices have been unified.
  </li>
</ol>
