<p>
  Insertion sort is a in-place sorting algorithm that proceeds by growing a sorted output list one element at a time. At each iteration, one element is removed from the input and inserted at the correct location within the sorted list. Insertion sort performs well on partially sorted arrays and small arrays.

<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

<p>
  Insertion sort proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Start at the second element of the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare the current element to the element to its left. If the current element is smaller then swap the elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continuing swapping until the current element is larger than the element to its left or the end of the array is reached.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this process for each subsequent element of the array.
  </li>
</ol>
