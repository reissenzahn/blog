<p>
  Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that proceeds by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm. Bucket sort assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution and uses this assumption to achieve linear average-case running time.
