<p>
  A doubly linked list consists of a set of sequentially linked nodes where each node stores a reference to both the previous and next nodes in the sequence. A head reference stores a reference to the first node in the sequence and a tail reference stores a reference to the last node. Traversal can be performed in either direction by following the next or previous references.

  To insert a node after a given node, we need to update the next and previous references of the new node as well as those of its predecessor and successor. For deletion, we need to update the next and predecessor link of the predecessor and successor of the target respectively so as to skip over the target node.

  To avoid having to account for edge cases at the beginning and end of the list, we can replace explicit head and tail references with a sentinel node. This sentinel has a next reference pointing to the head and a previous reference pointing to the tail. An empty list is then a sentinel node with both references pointing to itself.

  Other constant time operations include concatenating two lists together and splitting a list into two separate lists.
</p>

<p>
  In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence and a reference to an element of the list. The next reference of the tail points to null. In a circularly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence and a reference to an element of the list. The next reference of the tail points to the head.
</p>

<!-- 
  Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. If you'd like to find the K-th element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements. The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time.

Operation   Average case   Worst case
Search      O(n)           O(n)
Index       O(n)           O(n)
Insert      O(1)           O(1)
Delete      O(1)           O(1)
Space       O(n)           O(n)
