<p>
  A queue is a collection of elements that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the insertion of elements at one end (back) and the removal of elements from the other end (front). A queue is a first in, first out (FIFO) data structure as the first element to be inserted will be the first one to be removed.

<h3>Enqueue and Dequeue</h3>

<p>
  The enqueue operation inserts an element at the back of the queue. This can be implemented using a linked list by inserting an element at the tail of the list.
</p>

<p>
  The dequeue operation removes an element from the front of the queue. This can be implemented using a linked list by removing the element at the head of the list. A non-essential peek operation can also be included to return the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
