<p>
  A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the binary search property: each node has a key that is greater than the keys in its left subtree and less than the keys in its right subtree.

<h3>Searching for Keys</h3>

<p>
  To search for a certain target key we proceed as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Starting at the root node, inspect the key of the current node.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the target key is equal to the key then return successfully.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the target key is less than the key then search the left subtree.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the target key is greater than the key then move into the right subtree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this process until either the target key is found or a leaf node is reached.
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Inserting Keys</h3>

<p>
  To insert a key we proceed as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Starting at the root node, inspect the key of the current node.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the target key is less than the key then search the left subtree.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the target key is greater than the key then move into the right subtree.
  </li>
  <li>
    This process continues until a leaf node is reached at which point the key is inserted as the its right or left child as appropriate.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To handle duplicate values, we can move into the right subtree when the key is greater than or equal to the current key.
</p>


<h3>Deleting Keys</h3>

<p>
  When deleting a node, there are three scenarios to consider:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If the node is a leaf then simply remove it.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the node has one child then replace it with its child.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the node has two children then swap it with its in-order successor and attempt to delete it again.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To find the in-order successor of a node, we move to its right child (to find a node larger than the node) and then move to the left child repeatedly until we reach a leaf. As the successor cannot have a left sub-child we are guaranteed that deleting the node after it has been swapped will fall into one of the first two cases.
</p>

<p>
  Consistently using the in-order successor for every instance of the two-child case can lead to an unbalanced tree, so some implementations use either the in-order successor or the in-order predecessor at different times.
</p>


<h3>Maximums and Minimums</h3>

<p>
  To find the minimum key, go to the left child of the root; then go to the left child of that child, and so on, until you come to a node that has no left child. This node has the minimum key. Similarly, to find the maximum key, go to the right child of the root; then go to the right child of that child, and so on, until you come to a node that has no right child. This node has the maximum key.
</p>





<h3>Validate Binary Search Property</h3>

<p>
  To check if a binary tree is a binary search tree, we cannot simply check if each node the binary search tree for each node and its children. Instead, we need to check that each node as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the node is the left child of its parent, then it must be smaller than the parent and it must pass down the value from its parent to its right subtree to make sure none of the nodes in that subtree is greater than the parent.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the node is the right child of its parent, then it must be larger than the parent and it must pass down the value from its parent to its left subtree to make sure none of the nodes in that subtree is lesser than the parent.
  </li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>
  This can be performed by passing ranges down the tree. At the root, the key can be in (-∞, ∞). Now, say the root has key 10. Then its left child must be in (-∞, 10). If the left child has value 0 then it is valid and so its left child must be in (-∞, 0) and so on. Similarly, if the right child of the root must be in (10, ∞). Say the right child is 25, then its right child must be in (25, ∞) and so on. By checking all the nodes in the tree this way we can validate whether the binary search property does indeed hold.

<h3>Complexity</h3>

<p>
  In the worst case, a binary search tree will become very unbalanced and start to resemble a linked list.
