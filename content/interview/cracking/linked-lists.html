  Question: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
</p>

  Follow up: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
</p>


<h3>2.2 Return K-th to Last</h3>

<p>
  Question: Implement an algorithm to find the k-th to last element of a singly linked list.
</p>


<h3>2.3 Delete Middle Node</h3>

<p>
  Question: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node) of a singly linked list given only access to that node.
</p>


<h3>2.4 Partition</h3>

<p>
  Question: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
</p>



<h3>2.5 Sum Lists</h3>

<p>
  Question: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
