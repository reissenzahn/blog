  <li>
    Grate pecorino romano and thinly slice scallions.

  <li>
    Cook pasta according to package instructions in unsalted water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the garlic and cook stirring until fragrant but not browned (about 2 minutes).
  </li>
  <li>
    Add oyster sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce and stir to combine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer cooked pasta to garlic sauce and increase heat to high.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add cheese and scallions and stir and toss vigorously until the sauce is creamy and emulsified (about 30 seconds).

  <li>
    If sauce looks too watery, let it keep reducing; if it looks greasy, splash some more pasta water into it and let it re-emulsify.
