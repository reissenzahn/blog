<!-- #region introduction -->
<ul>
  <li>
    TFTP is a simple lockstep file transfer protocol which allows a client to read a file from or write a file to a remote host.
  </li>
  <li>
    The protocol was designed to be small and easy to implement and so lacks the features provided by more robust protocols.
  </li>
  <li>
    UDP is used as the underlying transport protocol.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- #region transfer identifiers -->
<h3>Transfer Identifiers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Each end of a connection starts by randomly choosing a TID between 0 and 65,535 for itself (typically from the range of ephemeral ports).
  </li>
  <li>
    A requesting host sends its initial request with its TID as the source port and 69 as the destination port in the UDP header.
  </li>
  <li>
    The response uses the TID chosen by the server as the source port and the TID chosen by the requestor as the destination port.
  </li>
  <li>
    The chosen TIDs are used for the remainder of the transfer and the hosts should check to ensure that the source TID matches what was agreed upon.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a source TID does not match then the packet should be discarded and an <code>ERROR</code> packet should be sent to the source of the packet while not disturbing the transfer.
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region initial connection -->
<h3>Initial Connection</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    A transfer is initiated by sending a request consisting of either a <code>WRQ</code> packet to write a file or a <code>RRQ</code> to read a file containing the filename and transfer mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Three transfer modes are available: netascii (transfer of a modified form of ASCII), octet (transfer of arbitrary 8-bit bytes) and mail (obsolete).
  </li>
  <li>
    The transfer is established upon receipt of a positive reply consisting of either an <code>ACK</code> packet (with block number zero) for a write or the first <code>DATA</code> packet for a read.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the reply is an <code>ERROR</code> packet then the request has been denied.
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region data transfer -->
<h3>Data Transfer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the server grants a transfer request then the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each <code>DATA</code> packet contains one block of data and must be acknowledged by an <code>ACK</code> packet before the next packet can be sent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each <code>DATA</code> packet has a block number. These block numbers begin with one and increase by one for each successive block.
  </li>
  <li>
    An <code>ACK</code> packet contains the block number of the <code>DATA</code> packet being acknowledged.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a packet gets lost then the intended recipient will timeout and retransmit its last packet (which may be a <code>DATA</code> or <code>ACK</code>) thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- #region termination -->
<h3>Termination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The end of a transfer is marked by a <code></code> packet that contains between 0 and 511 bytes of data.
  </li>
  <li>
    This packet is acknowledged by an <code>ACK</code> packet like all other <code>DATA</code> packets.
  </li>
  <li>
    The host acknowledging the final <code>DATA</code> packet may terminate its side of the connection on sending the final <code>ACK</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, it is encouraged that this host will wait for a while before terminating in order to retransmit the final <code>ACK</code> should it receive the final <code>DATA</code> packet again.
  </li>
  <li>
    In any case, the connection has been closed.
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region error handling -->
<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Errors are caused by three types of events:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Not being able to satisfy the request (e.g. file not found, access violation or no such user).
      </li>
      <li>
        Receiving a packet which cannot be explained by a delay or duplication in the network (e.g. malformed packet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Losing access to a necessary resource (e.g. disk full or access denied during transfer).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Most errors cause termination of the connection and an ERROR packet is sent with a suitable error code and message as a courtesy.
  </li>
  <li>
    An <code>ERROR</code> packet is not acknowledged and not retransmitted and so timeouts are instead used to detection such a termination.
  </li>
  <li>
    The only error condition that does not cause termination is the case in which the source port of a received packet is incorrect in which case an <code>ERROR</code> packet is sent to the source of the packet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each error code is a 2-byte integer. The available error codes are: Not defined (0), File not found (1), Access violation (2), Disk full or allocation exceeded (3), Illegal TFTP operation (4), Unknown transfer ID (5), File already exists (6), No such user (7).
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region netascii -->
<h3>Netascii</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Netascii is a modified form of ASCII that consists of basic ASCII ranging from 0x20 to 0x7F plus 8 control characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    The allowed control characters are 0x00 (NUL), 0x10 (LF), 0x13 (CR), 0x07 (BEL), 0x08 (BS), 0x09 (HT), 0x11 (VT) and 0x12 (FF).
  </li>
  <li>
    Another requirement is that newlines are always CRLF. Any CR can only be followed either by an LF or a NUL.
  </li>
  <li>
    All strings are encoded as a sequence of bytes in netascii terminated by a zero byte.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Option Extension</h3>

This document describes a simple extension to TFTP to
allow option negotiation prior to the file transfer.


   The option negotiation mechanism proposed in this document is a
   backward-compatible extension to the TFTP protocol.  It allows file
   transfer options to be negotiated prior to the transfer using a
   mechanism which is consistent with TFTP's Request Packet format.  The
   mechanism is kept simple by enforcing a request-respond-acknowledge
   sequence, similar to the lock-step approach taken by TFTP itself.

   While the option negotiation mechanism is general purpose, in that
   many types of options may be negotiated, it was created to support
   the Blocksize option defined in [2].  Additional options are defined
   in [3].


Packet Formats

   TFTP options are appended to the Read Request and Write Request
   packets.  A new type of TFTP packet, the Option Acknowledgment
   (OACK), is used to acknowledge a client's option negotiation request.
   A new error code, 8, is hereby defined to indicate that a transfer

   should be terminated due to option negotiation.

   Options are appended to a TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet
   as follows:

      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+-->
      |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode  | 0 |  opt1  | 0 | value1 | 0 | <
      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+-->

       >-------+---+---~~---+---+
      <  optN  | 0 | valueN | 0 |
       >-------+---+---~~---+---+

      opc
         The opcode field contains either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2,
         for Write Requests, as defined in [1].

      filename
         The name of the file to be read or written, as defined in [1].
         This is a NULL-terminated field.

      mode
         The mode of the file transfer: "netascii", "octet", or "mail",
         as defined in [1].  This is a NULL-terminated field.

      opt1
         The first option, in case-insensitive ASCII (e.g., blksize).
         This is a NULL-terminated field.

      value1
         The value associated with the first option, in case-
         insensitive ASCII.  This is a NULL-terminated field.

      optN, valueN
         The final option/value pair.  Each NULL-terminated field is
         specified in case-insensitive ASCII.

   The options and values are all NULL-terminated, in keeping with the
   original request format.  If multiple options are to be negotiated,
   they are appended to each other.  The order in which options are
   specified is not significant.  The maximum size of a request packet
   is 512 octets.

   The OACK packet has the following format:
      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+
      |  opc  |  opt1  | 0 | value1 | 0 |  optN  | 0 | valueN | 0 |
      +-------+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+---~~---+---+

      opc
         The opcode field contains a 6, for Option Acknowledgment.

      opt1
         The first option acknowledgment, copied from the original
         request.

      value1
         The acknowledged value associated with the first option.  If
         and how this value may differ from the original request is
         detailed in the specification for the option.

      optN, valueN
         The final option/value acknowledgment pair.

      
Negotiation Protocol

   The client appends options at the end of the Read Request or Write
   request packet, as shown above.  Any number of options may be
   specified; however, an option may only be specified once.  The order
   of the options is not significant.

   If the server supports option negotiation, and it recognizes one or
   more of the options specified in the request packet, the server may
   respond with an Options Acknowledgment (OACK).  Each option the
   server recognizes, and accepts the value for, is included in the
   OACK.  Some options may allow alternate values to be proposed, but
   this is an option specific feature.  The server must not include in
   the OACK any option which had not been specifically requested by the
   client; that is, only the client may initiate option negotiation.
   Options which the server does not support should be omitted from the
   OACK; they should not cause an ERROR packet to be generated.  If the
   value of a supported option is invalid, the specification for that
   option will indicate whether the server should simply omit the option
   from the OACK, respond with an alternate value, or send an ERROR
   packet, with error code 8, to terminate the transfer.

   An option not acknowledged by the server must be ignored by the
   client and server as if it were never requested.  If multiple options
   were requested, the client must use those options which were
   acknowledged by the server and must not use those options which were
   not acknowledged by the server.

   When the client appends options to the end of a Read Request packet,
   three possible responses may be returned by the server:

      OACK  - acknowledge of Read Request and the options;

      DATA  - acknowledge of Read Request, but not the options;

      ERROR - the request has been denied.

   When the client appends options to the end of a Write Request packet,
   three possible responses may be returned by the server:

      OACK  - acknowledge of Write Request and the options;

      ACK   - acknowledge of Write Request, but not the options;

      ERROR - the request has been denied.

   If a server implementation does not support option negotiation, it
   will likely ignore any options appended to the client's request.  In
   this case, the server will return a DATA packet for a Read Request
   and an ACK packet for a Write Request establishing normal TFTP data
   transfer.  In the event that a server returns an error for a request
   which carries an option, the client may attempt to repeat the request
   without appending any options.  This implementation option would
   handle servers which consider extraneous data in the request packet
   to be erroneous.

   Depending on the original transfer request there are two ways for a
   client to confirm acceptance of a server's OACK.  If the transfer was
   initiated with a Read Request, then an ACK (with the data block
   number set to 0) is sent by the client to confirm the values in the
   server's OACK packet.  If the transfer was initiated with a Write
   Request, then the client begins the transfer with the first DATA
   packet, using the negotiated values.  If the client rejects the OACK,
   then it sends an ERROR packet, with error code 8, to the server and
   the transfer is terminated.

   Once a client acknowledges an OACK, with an appropriate non-error
   response, that client has agreed to use only the options and values
   returned by the server.  Remember that the server cannot request an
   option; it can only respond to them.  If the client receives an OACK
   containing an unrequested option, it should respond with an ERROR
   packet, with error code 8, and terminate the transfer.

<h3>Blocksize Option</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The TFTP Blocksize Option allows the client and server to negotiate a blocksize more applicable to the network medium.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>RRQ</code> or <code>WRQ</code> packet is modified to include the string "blksize" and the number of octects in a block specified in ASCII,
  </li>
  <li>
    The blocksize refers to the number of data octets and does not include the four octets of TFTP header. Valid values range between 8 and 65464 octets, inclusive.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the server is willing to accept the blocksize option then it sends an <code>OACK</code> packet to the client. The specified value must be less than or equal to the value specified by the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    The client must then either use the size specified in the <code>OACK</code> or send an <code>ERROR</code> packet with error code 8 to terminate the transfer.
  </li>
  <li>
    The reception of a data packet with a data length less than the negotiated blocksize is the final packet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Increasing the blocksize can lead to decreased transfer times due to a reduction in the number of DATA and ACK packets sent. However, if the blocksize exceeds the path MTU then IP fragmentation and reassembly will begin to add more overhead.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
MISC

If the amount of data to be transfered is an integral multiple of the blocksize, an extra data packet containing no data is sent to end the transfer.

The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been received.

Each block of data is usually carried within a single IP packet in order to avoid IP fragmentation.

DATA packet is an acknowledgment for the first ACK packet of the
previous DATA packet. The WRQ and DATA packets are acknowledged by
ACK or ERROR packets, while RRQ and ACK packets are acknowledged by  DATA  or ERROR packets. 
-->

<!-- <h3>Example</h3> -->

<!-- As an example, the following shows the steps used to establish a connection to write a file.

1. Host A sends a WRQ to host B with source=A's TID, dest=69.
2. Host B sends a ACK (block number=0) to host A with source=B's TID, dest= A's TID.


    At this point the connection has been established and the first data
    packet can be sent by Host A with a sequence number of 1.  In the
    next step.
             
---

Initial Connection Protocol for reading a file

   1. Host  A  sends  a  "RRQ"  to  host  B  with  source= A's TID,
      destination= 69.

   2. Host B sends a "DATA" (with block number= 1) to host  A  with
      source= B's TID, destination= A's TID.

---

Host A sends a request to host B. Somewhere in the network, the request packet is duplicated, and as a result two acknowledgments are returned to host A, with different TID's chosen on host B in response to the two requests.  When the first response arrives, host A continues the connection.  When the second response to the request arrives, it should be rejected, but there is no reason to terminate the first connection.  Therefore, if different TID's are chosen for the two  connections on host B and host A checks the source TID's of the messages it receives, the first connection can be maintained while the second is rejected by returning an error packet. -->
