<!--
- XDR is a standard for the description and encoding of data that is useful for transferring data between different computer architectures.
- The XDR standard makes the assumption that bytes (or octets) are portable where a byte is defined as 8 bits of data.
-->


<h3>Basic Block Size</h3>

<!--
- The representation of all items requires a multiple of four bytes (or 32 bits) of data.
- The bytes are numbered 0 through n-1. The bytes are read or written to some byte stream such that byte m always precedes byte m+1.
- If the n bytes needed to contain the data are not a multiple of four then the n bytes are followed by enough (0 to 3) residual zero bytes r to make the total byte count a multiple of 4.
-->

+--------+--------+...+--------+--------+...+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1 |...|byte n-1|    0   |...|    0   |
+--------+--------+...+--------+--------+...+--------+
|<-----------n bytes---------->|<------r bytes------>|
|<-----------n+r (where (n+r) mod 4 = 0)>----------->|



<h3>Data Types</h3>


<!-- Angle brackets (< and >) denote variable-length sequences of data and square brackets ([ and ]) denote fixed-length sequences of data. The variables n, m, and r denote integers. -->


<h4>Integer</h4>

int identifier;

<!-- 
- An XDR signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648,2147483647].
- The integer is represented in two's complement notation. The most and least significant bytes are 0 and 3 respectively.
-->


  (MSB)                   (LSB)
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|byte 0 |byte 1 |byte 2 |byte 3 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
<------------32 bits------------>


<h4>Unsigned Integer</h4>

unsigned int identifier;

<!-- 
- An XDR unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a non-negative integer in the range [0,4294967295].
- It is represented by an unsigned binary number whose most and least significant bytes are 0 and 3 respectively.
-->

  (MSB)                   (LSB)
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|byte 0 |byte 1 |byte 2 |byte 3 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
<------------32 bits------------>


<h4>Enumeration</h4>

enum { name-identifier = constant, ... } identifier;

<!--
- Enumerations have the same representation as signed integers.
- It is an error to encode as an enum any integer other than those that have been given assignments in the enum declaration.
-->



<h3>Boolean</h3>

bool identifier;

<!--
- A boolean is equivalent to an enumeration with FALSE = 0 and TRUE = 1.
-->



4.5.  Hyper Integer and Unsigned Hyper Integer

hyper identifier;
unsigned hyper identifier;

Hyper and unsigned hyper integers are 64-bit (8-byte) numbers.
They are represented in two's complement notation. The most and
least significant bytes are 0 and 7, respectively.

  (MSB)                                                   (LSB)
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|byte 0 |byte 1 |byte 2 |byte 3 |byte 4 |byte 5 |byte 6 |byte 7 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
<----------------------------64 bits---------------------------->


4.6.  Floating-Point

The standard defines the floating-point data type "float" (32 bits or 4 bytes).
The encoding used is the IEEE standard for normalized single-precision floating-point numbers.

The following three
   fields describe the single-precision floating-point number:

S: The sign of the number.  Values 0 and 1 represent positive and  negative, respectively.  One bit.

E: The exponent of the number, base 2.  8 bits are devoted to this
         field.  The exponent is biased by 127.

F: The fractional part of the number's mantissa, base 2.  23 bits
         are devoted to this field.

   Therefore, the floating-point number is described by:

         (-1)**S * 2**(E-Bias) * 1.F

   It is declared as follows:

         float identifier;

+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|byte 0 |byte 1 |byte 2 |byte 3 |
S|   E   |           F          |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
1|<- 8 ->|<-------23 bits------>|
<------------32 bits------------>

   Just as the most and least significant bytes of a number are 0 and 3,
   the most and least significant bits of a single-precision floating-
   point number are 0 and 31.  The beginning bit (and most significant
   bit) offsets of S, E, and F are 0, 1, and 9, respectively.  Note that
   these numbers refer to the mathematical positions of the bits, and
   NOT to their actual physical locations (which vary from medium to
   medium).

   The IEEE specifications should be consulted concerning the encoding
   for signed zero, signed infinity (overflow), and denormalized numbers
   (underflow) [IEEE].  According to IEEE specifications, the "NaN" (not
   a number) is system dependent and should not be interpreted within
   XDR as anything other than "NaN".


4.7.  Double-Precision Floating-Point

   The standard defines the encoding for the double-precision floating-
   point data type "double" (64 bits or 8 bytes).  The encoding used is
   the IEEE standard for normalized double-precision floating-point
   numbers [IEEE].  The standard encodes the following three fields,
   which describe the double-precision floating-point number:

      S: The sign of the number.  Values 0 and 1 represent positive and
            negative, respectively.  One bit.

      E: The exponent of the number, base 2.  11 bits are devoted to
            this field.  The exponent is biased by 1023.

      F: The fractional part of the number's mantissa, base 2.  52 bits
            are devoted to this field.

   Therefore, the floating-point number is described by:

         (-1)**S * 2**(E-Bias) * 1.F

   It is declared as follows:

         double identifier;

         +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
         |byte 0|byte 1|byte 2|byte 3|byte 4|byte 5|byte 6|byte 7|
         S|    E   |                    F                        |
         +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
         1|<--11-->|<-----------------52 bits------------------->|
         <-----------------------64 bits------------------------->
                                        DOUBLE-PRECISION FLOATING-POINT

   Just as the most and least significant bytes of a number are 0 and 3,
   the most and least significant bits of a double-precision floating-
   point number are 0 and 63.  The beginning bit (and most significant
   bit) offsets of S, E, and F are 0, 1, and 12, respectively.  Note
   that these numbers refer to the mathematical positions of the bits,
   and NOT to their actual physical locations (which vary from medium to
   medium).

   The IEEE specifications should be consulted concerning the encoding
   for signed zero, signed infinity (overflow), and denormalized numbers
   (underflow) [IEEE].  According to IEEE specifications, the "NaN" (not
   a number) is system dependent and should not be interpreted within
   XDR as anything other than "NaN".



   The standard defines the encoding for the quadruple-precision
   floating-point data type "quadruple" (128 bits or 16 bytes).  The
   encoding used is designed to be a simple analog of the encoding used
   for single- and double-precision floating-point numbers using one
   form of IEEE double extended precision. 
   

<h4>Fixed-Length Opaque Data</h4>

opaque identifier[n];

<!--
Fixed-length uninterpreted data is called "opaque".
where the constant n is the (static) number of bytes necessary to
contain the opaque data.
If n is not a multiple of four, then the n bytes are followed by enough (0 to 3) residual zero bytes r to make the total byte count of the opaque object a multiple of four.
-->

    0        1     ...
+--------+--------+...+--------+--------+...+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1 |...|byte n-1|    0   |...|    0   |
+--------+--------+...+--------+--------+...+--------+
|<-----------n bytes---------->|<------r bytes------>|
|<-----------n+r (where (n+r) mod 4 = 0)------------>|



4.10.  Variable-Length Opaque Data

The standard also provides for variable-length (counted) opaque data,
defined as a sequence of n (numbered 0 through n-1) arbitrary bytes
to be the number n encoded as an unsigned integer (as described
below), and followed by the n bytes of the sequence.

Byte m of the sequence always precedes byte m+1 of the sequence, and
byte 0 of the sequence always follows the sequence's length (count).
If n is not a multiple of four, then the n bytes are followed by
enough (0 to 3) residual zero bytes, r, to make the total byte count
a multiple of four.  Variable-length opaque data is declared in the
following way:

    opaque identifier<m>;
or
    opaque identifier<>;

  The constant m denotes an upper bound of the number of bytes that the
  sequence may contain.  If m is not specified, as in the second
  declaration, it is assumed to be (2**32) - 1, the maximum length.

   The constant m would normally be found in a protocol specification.
   For example, a filing protocol may state that the maximum data
   transfer size is 8192 bytes, as follows:

         opaque filedata<8192>;

            0     1     2     3     4     5   ...
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+...+-----+-----+...+-----+
         |        length n       |byte0|byte1|...| n-1 |  0  |...|  0  |
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+...+-----+-----+...+-----+
         |<-------4 bytes------->|<------n bytes------>|<---r bytes--->|
                                 |<----n+r (where (n+r) mod 4 = 0)---->|
                                                  VARIABLE-LENGTH OPAQUE

   It is an error to encode a length greater than the maximum described
   in the specification.

   

4.11.  String

   The standard defines a string of n (numbered 0 through n-1) ASCII
   bytes to be the number n encoded as an unsigned integer (as described
   above), and followed by the n bytes of the string.  Byte m of the
   string always precedes byte m+1 of the string, and byte 0 of the
   string always follows the string's length.  If n is not a multiple of
   four, then the n bytes are followed by enough (0 to 3) residual zero
   bytes, r, to make the total byte count a multiple of four.  Counted
   byte strings are declared as follows:

         string object<m>;
      or
         string object<>;

   The constant m denotes an upper bound of the number of bytes that a
   string may contain.  If m is not specified, as in the second
   declaration, it is assumed to be (2**32) - 1, the maximum length.
   The constant m would normally be found in a protocol specification.
   For example, a filing protocol may state that a file name can be no
   longer than 255 bytes, as follows:

         string filename<255>;

            0     1     2     3     4     5   ...
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+...+-----+-----+...+-----+
         |        length n       |byte0|byte1|...| n-1 |  0  |...|  0  |
         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+...+-----+-----+...+-----+
         |<-------4 bytes------->|<------n bytes------>|<---r bytes--->|
                                 |<----n+r (where (n+r) mod 4 = 0)---->|
                                                                


   It is an error to encode a length greater than the maximum described
   in the specification.


4.12.  Fixed-Length Array

   Declarations for fixed-length arrays of homogeneous elements are in
   the following form:

         type-name identifier[n];

   Fixed-length arrays of elements numbered 0 through n-1 are encoded by
   individually encoding the elements of the array in their natural
   order, 0 through n-1.  Each element's size is a multiple of four
   bytes.  Though all elements are of the same type, the elements may
   have different sizes.  For example, in a fixed-length array of
   strings, all elements are of type "string", yet each element will
   vary in its length.

         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+...+---+---+---+---+
         |   element 0   |   element 1   |...|  element n-1  |
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+...+---+---+---+---+
         |<--------------------n elements------------------->|

                                               FIXED-LENGTH ARRAY


4.13.  Variable-Length Array

   Counted arrays provide the ability to encode variable-length arrays
   of homogeneous elements.  The array is encoded as the element count n
   (an unsigned integer) followed by the encoding of each of the array's
   elements, starting with element 0 and progressing through element
   n-1.  The declaration for variable-length arrays follows this form:

         type-name identifier<m>;
      or
         type-name identifier<>;

   The constant m specifies the maximum acceptable element count of an
   array; if m is not specified, as in the second declaration, it is
   assumed to be (2**32) - 1.

           0  1  2  3
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+...+--+--+--+--+
         |     n     | element 0 | element 1 |...|element n-1|
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+...+--+--+--+--+
         |<-4 bytes->|<--------------n elements------------->|
                                                         COUNTED ARRAY


   It is an error to encode a value of n that is greater than the
   maximum described in the specification.


4.14.  Structure

   Structures are declared as follows:

         struct {
            component-declaration-A;
            component-declaration-B;
            ...
         } identifier;

   The components of the structure are encoded in the order of their
   declaration in the structure.  Each component's size is a multiple of
   four bytes, though the components may be different sizes.

         +-------------+-------------+...
         | component A | component B |...                      STRUCTURE
         +-------------+-------------+...

       
4.15.  Discriminated Union

   A discriminated union is a type composed of a discriminant followed
   by a type selected from a set of prearranged types according to the
   value of the discriminant.  The type of discriminant is either "int",
   "unsigned int", or an enumerated type, such as "bool".  The component
   types are called "arms" of the union and are preceded by the value of
   the discriminant that implies their encoding.  Discriminated unions
   are declared as follows:

         union switch (discriminant-declaration) {
         case discriminant-value-A:
            arm-declaration-A;
         case discriminant-value-B:
            arm-declaration-B;
         ...
         default: default-declaration;
         } identifier;

   Each "case" keyword is followed by a legal value of the discriminant.
   The default arm is optional.  If it is not specified, then a valid
   encoding of the union cannot take on unspecified discriminant values.
   The size of the implied arm is always a multiple of four bytes.

   The discriminated union is encoded as its discriminant followed by
   the encoding of the implied arm.


           0   1   2   3
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |  discriminant |  implied arm  |          DISCRIMINATED UNION
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         |<---4 bytes--->|


<h4>Void</h4>

An XDR void is a 0-byte quantity.

void;

  ++
  ||
  ++
--><-- 0 bytes


4.17.  Constant

   The data declaration for a constant follows this form:

         const name-identifier = n;

   "const" is used to define a symbolic name for a constant; it does not
   declare any data.  The symbolic constant may be used anywhere a
   regular constant may be used.  For example, the following defines a
   symbolic constant DOZEN, equal to 12.

         const DOZEN = 12;

         
4.18.  Typedef

   "typedef" does not declare any data either, but serves to define new
   identifiers for declaring data.  The syntax is:

         typedef declaration;

   The new type name is actually the variable name in the declaration
   part of the typedef.  For example, the following defines a new type
   called "eggbox" using an existing type called "egg":

         typedef egg eggbox[DOZEN];



   Variables declared using the new type name have the same type as the
   new type name would have in the typedef, if it were considered a
   variable.  For example, the following two declarations are equivalent
   in declaring the variable "fresheggs":

         eggbox  fresheggs; egg     fresheggs[DOZEN];

   When a typedef involves a struct, enum, or union definition, there is
   another (preferred) syntax that may be used to define the same type.
   In general, a typedef of the following form:

         typedef <<struct, union, or enum definition>> identifier;

   may be converted to the alternative form by removing the "typedef"
   part and placing the identifier after the "struct", "union", or
   "enum" keyword, instead of at the end.  For example, here are the two
   ways to define the type "bool":

         typedef enum {    /* using typedef */
            FALSE = 0,
            TRUE = 1
         } bool;

         enum bool {       /* preferred alternative */
            FALSE = 0,
            TRUE = 1
         };

   This syntax is preferred because one does not have to wait until the
   end of a declaration to figure out the name of the new type.


4.19.  Optional-Data

Optional-data is one kind of union that occurs so frequently that we give it a special syntax of its own for declaring it.  It is declared as follows:

         type-name *identifier;

   This is equivalent to the following union:

         union switch (bool opted) {
         case TRUE:
            type-name element;
         case FALSE:
            void;
         } identifier;



   It is also equivalent to the following variable-length array
   declaration, since the boolean "opted" can be interpreted as the
   length of the array:

         type-name identifier<1>;

   Optional-data is not so interesting in itself, but it is very useful
   for describing recursive data-structures such as linked-lists and
   trees.  For example, the following defines a type "stringlist" that
   encodes lists of zero or more arbitrary length strings:

        struct stringentry {
           string item<>;
           stringentry *next;
        };

        typedef stringentry *stringlist;

   It could have been equivalently declared as the following union:

         union stringlist switch (bool opted) {
         case TRUE:
            struct {
               string item<>;
               stringlist next;
            } element;
         case FALSE:
            void;
         };

   or as a variable-length array:

        struct stringentry {
           string item<>;
           stringentry next<1>;
        };

        typedef stringentry stringlist<1>;

   Both of these declarations obscure the intention of the stringlist
   type, so the optional-data declaration is preferred over both of
   them.  The optional-data type also has a close correlation to how
   recursive data structures are represented in high-level languages
   such as Pascal or C by use of pointers.  In fact, the syntax is the
   same as that of the C language for pointers.






<h3>Example</h3>

Here is a short XDR data description of a thing called a "file",
which might be used to transfer files from one machine to another.

  const MAXUSERNAME = 32;     /* max length of a user name */
  const MAXFILELEN = 65535;   /* max length of a file      */
  const MAXNAMELEN = 255;     /* max length of a file name */

  /*
  * Types of files:
  */
  enum filekind {
    TEXT = 0,       /* ascii data */
    DATA = 1,       /* raw data   */
    EXEC = 2        /* executable */
  };

  /*
  * File information, per kind of file:
  */
  union filetype switch (filekind kind) {
  case TEXT:
    void;                           /* no extra information */
  case DATA:
    string creator<MAXNAMELEN>;     /* data creator         */
  case EXEC:
    string interpretor<MAXNAMELEN>; /* program interpretor  */
  };

  /*
  * A complete file:
  */
  struct file {
    string filename<MAXNAMELEN>; /* name of file    */
    filetype type;               /* info about file */
    string owner<MAXUSERNAME>;   /* owner of file   */
    opaque data<MAXFILELEN>;     /* file data       */
  };

Suppose now that there is a user named "john" who wants to store his
lisp program "sillyprog" that contains just the data "(quit)".  His
file would be encoded as follows:

OFFSET  HEX BYTES       ASCII    COMMENTS
------  ---------       -----    --------
0      00 00 00 09     ....     -- length of filename = 9
4      73 69 6c 6c     sill     -- filename characters
8      79 70 72 6f     ypro     -- ... and more characters ...
12      67 00 00 00     g...     -- ... and 3 zero-bytes of fill
16      00 00 00 02     ....     -- filekind is EXEC = 2
20      00 00 00 04     ....     -- length of interpretor = 4
24      6c 69 73 70     lisp     -- interpretor characters
28      00 00 00 04     ....     -- length of owner = 4
32      6a 6f 68 6e     john     -- owner characters
36      00 00 00 06     ....     -- length of file data = 6
40      28 71 75 69     (qui     -- file data bytes ...
44      74 29 00 00     t)..     -- ... and 2 zero-bytes of fill




11.  ANSI/IEEE Standard 754-1985

   The definition of NaNs, signed zero and infinity, and denormalized
   numbers from [IEEE] is reproduced here for convenience.  The
   definitions for quadruple-precision floating point numbers are
   analogs of those for single and double-precision floating point
   numbers and are defined in [IEEE].

   In the following, 'S' stands for the sign bit, 'E' for the exponent,
   and 'F' for the fractional part.  The symbol 'u' stands for an
   undefined bit (0 or 1).

   For single-precision floating point numbers:
