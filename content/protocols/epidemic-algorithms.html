When a database is replicated at many sites, maintaining mutual consistency among the sites in the face of updates is a significant problem.

This paper describes several randomized algorithms for distributing updates and driving the replicas toward consistency.

The algorithms are simple and require few guarantees from the underlying communication system yet they ensure that the effect of every update is eventually reflected in all replicas.

The cost and performance of the algorithms are tuned by choosing appropriate distributions in the randomization step.

The algorithms are closely analogous to epidemics.
