<!-- 
- SWIM is a membership protocol that provides each member of a group of processes with a locally-maintained list of other non-faulty processes in the group.
- The membership list is updated to reflect members joining the group or dropping out (either voluntarily or through a failure).
- The SWIM approach has two components: 1) a failure detector component that detects failures of members and 2) a dissemination component that disseminates information about members that have recently either joined or left the group or failed.
- Processes are monitored by means of an peer-to-peer periodic randomized probing protocol and information about membership changes is disseminated by piggybacking on ping and ack messages.
- The rate of false failure detections is reduced by allowing members to suspect a process before declaring it as failed.

<h3>Failure Detection</h3>

<!--
- The failure detection algorithm uses two parameters: the protocol period T' in units of time and the size of failure detection subgroups k.
- The protocol does not require clocks to be synchronized across members and the properties of the protocol hold if T' is the average protocol period at the various group members.

- We consider an arbitrary member M_i.
- During each protocol period of length T' on its local clock, M_i chooses a random member M_j from its membership list and sends it a PING.
- M_i then waits for a replying ACK from M_j.
- If this reply is not received within a pre-specified timeout then M_i indirectly probes M_j.
- M_i selects k members at random and sends them a PING-REQ(M_j).
- On receiving this message, each of the k members sends a PING to M_j and forwards the ACK from M_j back to M_i.
- At the end of this protocol period, M_i checks if it has directly or indirectly received any ACK.
- If no ACK has been received then M_i declares M_j as failed in its membership list and hands this update to the Dissemination Component.

- This approach avoids the effect of any congestion on the network path between M_i and M_j which might have led to the dropping of the original PING or its ACK.
- The data contained in each message of this protocol is tagged with the unique sequence number of the protocol period at the initiator M_i.
- The pre-specified time-out used to initiate indirect probing is based on an estimate of the distribution of round-trip time (e.g. an average).
- The protocol period T' has to be at least three times the round-trip estimate.
- The original authors used the average measured round-trip time to se the timeout and used a protocol period significantly larger than this value.
-->


<h3>Dissemination Component</h3>

<!--
- The basic SWIM protocol propagates membership updates using via network multicast.
- Upon detecting the failure of a group member, the process multicasts this information to the rest of the group as FAILED(M_j).
- A member receiving this message deletes M_j from its local membership list.
- Information about newly joined members or voluntarily leaving members are multicast in a similar manner.
- For a process to join the group, it would need to know at least one contact member in the group.

- The use of an external multicast primitive can be eliminated altogether by instead piggybacking the information to be disseminated on the PING, PING-REQ and ACK messages generated by the failure detector protocol.
- This results in an infection style of dissemination that is resilient to process failures and loss of messages within the network.
- This completely eliminates the generation of extra packets by the dissemination component. The only packets generated by SWIM are then the PING, PING-REQ and ACK messages thus giving a constant expected message overhead per group member.

- Each group member M_i maintains a buffer of recent membership updates along with a local count for each buffer element.
- The local count specifies the number of times the element has been piggybacked so far by M_i and is used to choose which elements to piggyback next.
- If the size of this buffer is larger than the maximum number of elements that can be piggybacked on a single PING or ACK then elements that have been gossiped fewer times are preferred.
- This is needed as the protocol period is fixed and the rate of membership changes might temporarily overwhelm the speed of dissemination.
- Preferring younger elements ensures that all membership changes infect at least a few members.
- Each element is piggybacked at most λlog(n) times where λ is a parameter.

- The implementation used by the original authors maintains two separate lists of group members: one containing a list of members that are not yet declared as failed in the group and a second list of members that have failed recently.
- Currently, an equal number of buffer elements is chosen from these two lists for piggybacking but the scheme could be generalized to adapt to relative variations in process join, leave and failure rates.

<h3>Suspicion Mechanism</h3>

<!--
- If a non-faulty group member M_j is mistakenly detected as failed by another group member M_i (e.g. due to network packet losses or due to M_j being temporarily asleep) then M_j will be declared as failed in the group.
- That is, a healthy process M_j will be forced to drop out of the group at the very first instance that it is mistakenly detected as failed.
- This leads to a high rate of false positives in detecting failures.
- We reduce this effect by introducing the suspicion sub-protocol which is run whenever a failure is detected by the failure detector protocol.

- Consider a member M_i that chooses a member M_j as a PING target in the current protocol periods and receives no ACK after running the failure detector protocol.
- Instead of declaring M_j as failed, M_i marks M_j as a suspected member in its local membership list.
- Further, a {Suspect M_j : M_i suspects M_j} message is disseminated by means of the dissemination component.
- Any group member M_l receiving such a message also marks M_j as suspected.
- Suspected members stay on in the membership list and are treated similar to non-faulty members with regards to the PING target selection operation of the failure detection protocol.
- If a member M_l successfully pings a suspected member M_j, it un-marks the previous suspicion of M_j in its membership list and spreads an {Alive M_j : M_l knows M_j is alive} message via the dissemination component.
- This message un-marks the suspected member M_j in membership lists of recipient members.
- If member M_j receives a message suspecting it the it can start propagating an Alive message clarifying it has not failed.
- Suspected entries in membership lists expire after a pre-specified timeout.
- If M_j is suspected at some member M_h and this entry times-out before receipt of an Alive message then M_h declares M_j as faulty, drops it from its local membership list and begins spreading the message {Confirm M_j : M_h declares M_j as faulty} via the dissemination component.
- This message overrides any previous Suspect or Alive message and cascades in deletion of M_j from the membership lists of all recipients.

- Now, we have that Alive messages override Suspect message and that Confirm messages override both Suspect and Alive messages in their effect on the local membership list element corresponding to the suspected member.
- However, a member might be suspected and unsuspected multiple times during its lifetime. These multiple versions of Suspect and Alive messages (all pertaining to the same member M_j) need to be distinguished through unique identifiers.
- These identifiers are provided by using a virtual incarnation number field with each element in the membership lists. Incarnation numbers are global.
- A member M_i’s incarnation number is initialized to 0 when it joins the group, and it can be incremented only by M_i when it receives information (through the dissemination component) about itself being suspected in the current incarnation.
- M_i then generates an Alive message with its identifier and an incremented incarnation number and spreads this through the Dissemination Component to the group. 

Thus, Suspect, Alive and Confirm messages contain the incarnation number of the member. The order of preference among these messages and their effect on the membership list is as follows:

- {Alive M_l, inc = i} overrides {Alive M_l, inc = j}, i > j and {Suspect M_l, inc = j}, i > j 
- {Suspect M_l, inc = i} overrides {Alive M_l, inc = j}, i >= j and {Suspect M_l, inc = j}, i > j
- {Confirm M_l, inc = i} overrides {Alive M_l, inc = j}, any j and {Suspect M_l, inc = j}, any j

- These orders of preferences and overriding are required to maintain the desired correctness properties 

The preference rules and infection-style Dissemination Component also accommodate suspicions of a process by multiple other processes.

Preference rules do not depend on the source of suspicion, and the infection-style dissemina-tion spreads a message (Suspect, Alive or Confirm) quicker if there are multiple sources, with exactly the same overhead per process as with one source of infection [8]. 


This mechanism reduces (but does not eliminate) the rate of failure detection false positives.

Notice also that the Strong Completeness property of the original protocol con-tinues to hold. Failures of processes suspecting a failed pro-cess M_j may prolong detection time, but eventual detection is guaranteed.

<h3>Round-Robin Probe Target Selection</h3>

<!-- 
- The failure detector protocol detects failures in an average constant number of protocol periods.
- Although each process failure is guaranteed to be detected eventually at every other non-faulty process (eventual strong completeness), a pathological selection of ping targets across the group might lead to a large delay in the first detection of the process failure anywhere in the group.
- In the extreme case, this delay could be unbounded as the failed process might never be chosen as a ping target by any other non-faulty process.
- This can be solved by the following modification to the protocol. The failure detection protocol at member M_i works by maintaining a list of the known elements of the current membership list and selecting PING targets in a round-robin fashion.
- A newly joining member is inserted in the membership list at a position that is chosen uniformly at random.
- On completing a traversal of the entire list, M_i rearranges the membership list to a random reordering.
- This way, once another member M_j is include in M_i's membership list, it will be chosen as a PING target exactly once during each traversal of M_i's membership list.
-  This bounds the worst case detection time of a process failure of any member by M_i while preserving the average failure detection time of the original protocol since the randomization of the membership lists at different members across the group leads to a similar distribution of PING target choices by each member.

CONCLUSIONS

SWIM is a scalable weakly-consistent process group membership protocol.

The SWIM project is motivated by the unscalability of heartbeat-based protocols.

SWIM’s solution is based on a separation of the failure detector and membership update dissemination components of the problem.

The SWIM failure detector achieves scalability by avoiding heartbeating, and by using a random peer-to-peer probing of processes instead.

This provides constant overhead on group members, as well as constant expected detection time of failures.

Membership updates are propagated efficiently and reliably in infection-style (epidemic-style), by piggybacking on packets generated by the failure detector protocol.

The addition of a suspicion mechanism (with virtual incarnation numbers) reduces the false positive frequency, while trading off failure detection time.

A final extension to the protocol guarantees time bounded detection of failures at each non-faulty process.



PERFORMANCE

Membership changes have to be propagated within the group quickly after their occurrence.

The asynchrony and unreliability of the underlying network can cause messages to be lost, leading to false detection of process failures, since a process that is losing messages is indistinguishable from one that has failed. This rate of false positives has to be low.

Finally, the protocol needs to be peer-to-peer, and impose low message and computation loads on the network and processes.

... the SWIM project to implement a membership sub-system that provides stable failure detection time, stable rate of false positives and low message load per group member...


Mathematical analysis showed that as the group size is scaled up, the protocol’s properties of (expected) failure detection time, rate of false positives, and message load per member, are all independent of the group size.


---

Both the expected time to first detection of each process failure and the expected message load per member, do not vary with group size.

Our system, called SWIM, provides a membership substrate that:

(1) imposes a constant message load per group member;

(2) detects a process failure in an (expected) constant time at some non-faulty process in the group; (3) provides a deterministic bound (as a function of group size) on the local time that a non-faulty process takes to detect failure of another process;

(4) propagates membership updates, including information about failures, in infection-style (also gossip-style or epidemic-style); the dissemination latency in the group grows slowly (logarithmically) with the number of members;

(5) provides a mechanism to reduce the rate of false positives by “suspecting” a process before “declaring” it as failed within the group.


Finally, the protocol guarantees a deterministic time bound to detect failures.



MISC

SWIM provides weakly-consistent. We focus on a weaker variant of group membership, where membership lists at different members need not be consistent across the group at the same (causal) point in time.



Suspicion mechanism, where a pro-cess that is unresponsive to ping messages, as generated by the SWIM failure detector protocol described in Sec-tion 3, is not immediately declared as “faulty”. Instead, the process is declared as “suspected”, and this information spread through the group using the Dissemination Compo-nent. After a prespecified time-out (we discuss values for this parameter in Section 5), the suspected process is de-clared as “faulty” and this information disseminated to the group. However, if the suspected process responds to a ping request before this time-out expires, information about this is disseminated to the group as an “alive” message. The process is then rejuvenated in membership lists at different members without ever having to leave or rejoin the group. This prespecified time-out thus effectively trades off an in-crease in failure detection time for a reduction in frequency of false failure detections. The basic SWIM failure detection protocol guarantees eventual detection of the failure of an arbitrary process  , at each non-faulty group member  . However, it gives no deterministic guarantees on the time between failure of an arbitrary member  and its detection at another arbi-trary member  (in terms of the number of local proto-col rounds at  ). Section 4.3 describes a modification to the original SWIM failure detector protocol that guarantees such a Time Bounded Completeness property; the time in-terval between the occurrence of a failure and its detection at member  is no more than two times the group size (in number of protocol periods).
