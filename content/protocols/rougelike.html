This is invariably done using Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm.



<h3>Recursive Shadow Casting</h3>

- Recursive shadow casting divides the field of view into eight octants with shared edges.

- The algorithm scans an octant row by row or column by column, depending on the octant. In each octant the rows/columns closest to the starting point are scanned first.
  - In octant 1 and 6 the scans are performed row by row, going from the leftmost cell to the rightmost cell in each row.
  - In octant 2 and 5 the scans are performed row by row, going from the rightmost cell to the leftmost cell in each row.
  - In octant 3 and 8 the scans are performed column by column, going from the topmost cell to the bottom most cell in each column.
  - In octant 4 and 7 the scans are performed column by column, going from the bottom most cell to the topmost cell in each column.

- When an opaque cell is found, a new scan is recursively initiated on row/column further away, covering the area up until the first cell in the shadow of the opaque cell.
- This is achieved by 




  
- The slope between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by slope = (x1 - x2) / (y1 - y2) and the inverse slope is simply 1 / slope.


- When a blocking cell is found a new scan is recursively started one row/column further away, covering the area up until the first cell in shadow of the blocker. The rest of the initial row/column is scanned and subsequent blocking cells directly adjacent to the initial blocker is skipped. If a new section of non-blocking cells, followed by a blocker, is found the procedure is repeated.


- The initial start slope 

- If we were to draw a line from the center of the starting cell to the center of the leftmost cell in any of these rows we would find that the slope is 1. We call this the scan's start slope. If we would do the same for the rightmost cell the slope would be 0. This slope is called the end slope.

- When we reach the 12th row things are becoming a bit more interesting. The recursion is started when we get to row 12 and hit the blocking cells.



When the first blocking cell is hit (x) a new scan is started on row 13. The start slope is ofcourse the same as for all of the previous rows (ie. 1), but the end slope is different. The end slope is calculated using a line from the starting point to a point that 'brushes' by to the left of the blocking cell. If we zoom in it looks something like this:

Ok, so now we have two scans; the original that continues to scan row 12 until the rightmost cell is reached and a new scan that scans row 13 from the leftmost cell (start slope 1) to the cell at row 13 that intersects the line with a slope of 0.82 (end slope):

 2222............. 16  # = blocking cell
  2222..###....... 15  . = non-blocking cell
   222..###....... 14  
    222.###..#..## 13  1 = original scan 
     111##11111111 12  2 = new scan

Ok, lets return to the original scan on row 12. The scan had just come across the first blocking cell and recursively started a new scan one row further away with a new end slope. The original scan now checks the next cell and finds that this one is also a blocking cell. Since the previous cell was a blocking cell too, we have come across a section of blocker and just continue scanning until we reach a non blocking cell:

 ................. 16  # = blocking cell
  ......###....... 15  . = non-blocking cell
   .....###....... 14  
    ....###..#..## 13 
     ...##o....... 12  o = first non-blocking cell after a section of blockers

When the first non-blocking cell is found after a section of blockers we need to calculate a new start slope for the scan. This is done using a line from the center of the starting cell to a point that 'brushes' by to the right of the blocking cell. If we zoom in it looks something like this:

 ##########aoooo  o = first non-blocking cell
 ##########o   o  a = point that 'brushes' by to the
 ##########o   o      right of the blocking cell
 ##########o   o
 ##########ooooo
 +---++---++---+
 |   ||   ||   |
 |   ||   ||   |
 |   ||   ||   |
 +---++---++---+

Thus, the new start slope of the original scan is obtained using a line from the center of the starting cell to the point marked 'a' in the figure. This gives a start slope of 0.6.

Ok, once a scan has reached it's last cell the scan is finished and a new scan is started one row further away if, and only if, the last cell was a non-blocking cell. In the case of our original scan the last cell was a non-blocking cell so a new scan is started one row further away with the new start slope of 0.6 (instead of the old 1).


When the original scan starts on row 13 a blocking cell is immediately found:

 ................. 16  # = blocking cell
  ......###....... 15  . = non-blocking cell
   .....###....... 14  
    ....##x..#..## 13  x = blocking cell in original scan

 Fig.4h Starting with a blocking cell
When this happens we continue scanning until a non-blocking cell is found. In this case the next cell is a non-blocking cell and we calculate a new start slope in the same manner as on row 12 when we passed the section of blockers. After this is done we continue to scan from left to right until we reach the last cell or until we hit a blocking cell. In our example a blocking cell is found before we reach the last cell:

 ................. 16  # = blocking cell
  ......###....... 15  . = non-blocking cell
   .....###....... 14  
    ....##...x..## 13  x = blocking cell in original scan

 Fig.4i Another blocking cell
A new scan is now recursively started in the same way as on row 12. The scan has the same start slope as the original scan (0.6) and an end slope of a line that 'brushes' by to the left of the blocking cell (marked x in fig.4i). Now we have three active scans:

 2222......33..... 16
  2222..##333..... 15
   222..##333..... 14  
    222.###11#11## 13  

 Fig.4j Active scans
The same procedure is repeated once more when we move out of the blocking cell, find two new non-blocking cells and the run into yet another blocking cell:

 2222......33444.. 16
  2222..##333.44.. 15
   222..##333.44.. 14  
    222.##111#11## 13  

When the original scan ends at the rightmost cell in row 13 we end with a blocking instead of a non-blocking, as we did in row 12. Since the original scan ended with a blocking cell a new scan is NOT started one row further away. We now have scan 2, 3 and 4 to do the job of scanning the rest of the field of view. These scans follow the same procedures and rules as the original scan.

When the scans are done we get this field of view:

 ....ssssss.....ss 16  @ = starting cell
  ....ssss#..s..ss 15  # = blocking cell
   ...ssss#..s..ss 14  . = non-blocking cell
    ...ss##..#..## 13  s = shadowed cells
     ...##........ 12
      ............ 11
       ........... 10
        .......... 9
         ......... 8
          ........ 7
           ....... 6
            ...... 5
             ..... 4
              .... 3
               ... 2
                .. 1
                 @
This procedure is repeated on the other octants, thus producing a complete field of view.
