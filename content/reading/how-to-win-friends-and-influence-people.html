<h3>I. FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE</h3>

<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>

<p>
  People don't blame or criticize themselves for anything.
</p>

<p>
  Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sends of importance and arouses resentment.
</p>

<p>
  B.F. Skinner proved in his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.
</p>

<p>
  By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.
</p>

<p>
  "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation." ~ Hans Selye
</p>

<p>
  Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home.
</p>

<p>
  The person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself and condemn us in return.
</p>

<p>
  "Judge not, that ye be not judged."
</p>

<p>
  "Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances." ~ Abraham Lincoln
</p>

<p>
  Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.
</p>

<p>
  Do you know someone you would like to change, regulated and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous.
</p>

<p>
  "Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof when your own doorstep is unclean" ~ Confucius
</p>

<p>
  If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism—no matter how certain we are that it is justified.
</p>

<p>
  When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
</p>

<p>
  "I will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of everybody." ~ Benjamin Franklin
</p>

<p>
  Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.
</p>

<p>
  "A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men." ~ Thomas Carlyle
</p>

<p>
  Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breads sympathy, tolerance and kindness.
</p>

<p>
  "To know all is to forgive all."
</p>

<p>
  God himself does not propose to judge man until the end of his days. Why should you and I?
</p>

<p>
  Principle 1: Don't criticize, condemn or complain.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>

<p>
  There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. And that is by making the other person want to do it. Remember, there is no other way.
</p>

<p>
  Almost all of our wants are usually gratified. But there is one longing—almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep—which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls the 'desire to be great' and what John Dewey calls the 'desire to be important'.
</p>

<p>
  "Everybody likes a compliment." ~ Abraham Lincoln
</p>

<p>
  "The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated." ~ William James
</p>

<p>
  Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger and the rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in the palm of his hand and 'even the undertaker will be sorry when he dies'.
</p>

<p>
  If our ancestors hadn't had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would have been impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals.
</p>

<p>
  If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.
</p>

<p>
  Some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it. Imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.
</p>

<p>
  "I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement." ~ Charles Schwab
</p>

<p>
  "I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise." ~ Charles Schwab
</p>

<p>
  "In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world, I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted in his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism." ~ Charles Schwab
</p>

<p>
  "Here lies oe who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself." ~ Andrew Carnegie
</p>

<p>
  Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.
</p>

<p>
  The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
</p>

<p>
  "Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you." ~ Alvaro Obregon
</p>

<p>
  "Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise." ~ King George V
</p>

<p>
  Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.
</p>

<p>
  When we are engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other person's good points, we won't have to resort to flattery.
</p>

<p>
  In our interpersonal relations, we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.
</p>

<p>
  "I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let we not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."
</p>

<p>
  "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>

<p>
  Let's cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other person's good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>

<p>
  It is necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.
</p>

<p>
  Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.
</p>

<p>
  The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.
</p>

<p>
  "Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire ... and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in hte other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way." ~ Harry A. Overstreet
</p>

<p>
  Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?" That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.
</p>

<p>
  "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own." ~ Henry Ford
</p>

<p>
  The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.
</p>

<p>
  "People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them." ~ Owen D. Young
</p>

<p>
  Looking at the other person's point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.
</p>

<p>
  "Self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature." ~ William Winter
</p>

<p>
  When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why no let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.
</p>



<h3>II. SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU</h3>

<h3 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h3>

<p>
  A dog is the only animal tht doesn't have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love.
</p>

<p>
  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
</p>

<p>
  People are not interested in you. They are interested in themselves.
</p>

<p>
  When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do you look for first?
</p>

<p>
  If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true friends.
</p>

<p>
  "Josephine, I have been as fortunate as any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can rely." ~ Napoleon
</p>

<p>
  "It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring." ~ Alfred Adler
</p>

<p>
  "I am grateful because these people come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I'm going to give them the very best I possibly can." ~ Howard Thurston
</p>

<p>
  "I love my audience. I love my audience." ~ Howard Thurston
</p>

<p>
  One can win the attention, time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.
</p>

<p>
  All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a king upon his throne—all of us like people who admire us.
</p>

<p>
  If we want to make friends, let's put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.
</p>

<p>
  If we want to make friends, let's greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say 'Hello' in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have the person call.
</p>

<p>
  "We are interested in others when they are interested in us." ~ Publilius Syrus
</p>

<p>
  A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way street—both parties benefit.
</p>

<p>
  If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself then become genuinely interested in other people.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>

<p>
  The expression one wears on one's face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one's back.
</p>

<p>
  Actions speak louder than words and a smile says, 'I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.'
</p>

<p>
  This is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them.
</p>

<p>
  An insincere grin? No. That doesn't fool anybody. We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.
</p>

<p>
  "People who smile tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There's far more information in a smile than a frown. That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment." ~ James V. McConnell
</p>

<p>
  The effect of a smile is powerful—even when it is unseen. Your 'smile' comes through in your voice.
</p>

<p>
  You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.
</p>

<p>
  You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.
</p>

<p>
  "Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not." ~ William James
</p>

<p>
  Everybody in the work is seeking happiness—and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.
</p>

<p>
  "There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so." ~ William Shakespeare
</p>

<p>
  "Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds up to be." ~ Abe Lincoln
</p>

<p>
  "Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual... Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude—the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis." ~ Elbert Hubbard
</p>

<p>
  Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through the clouds.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 2: Smile.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3>

<p>
  The average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that name and call it easily and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
  When Andrew Carnegie was a boy back in Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a mother rabbit. Presto! He soon had a whole nest of little rabbits—and nothing to feed them. But he had a brilliant idea. He told the boys and girls in the neighborhood that if they would go out and pull enough clover and dandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in their honour. The plan worked like magic and Carnegie never forgot it.
</p>

<p>
  Carnegie pictured in glowing terms the mutual advantages of a merger between his and George Pullman's companies. Pullman was not wholly convinced. Finally he asked, 'What would you call the new company?' and Carnegie replied promptly: 'Why, the Pullman Palace Car Company, of course.' Pullman's face brightened. 'Come into my room,' he said. 'Let's talk it over.' that talk made industrial history.
</p>

<p>
  The policy of remembering and honoring the names of his friends and business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie's leadership. He was proud of the fact that he could call many of his factory workers by their first names and he boasted that, while he was personally in charge, no strike every disturbed his flaming steel mills.
</p>

<p>
  Most people don't remember names, for the simple reason that they don't take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy. Bu they were probably no busier than Franklin D. Roosevelt and he took time to remember and recall even the names of mechanics with whom he came into contact.
</p>

<p>
  One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: 'To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.'
</p>

<p>
  "Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>

<p>
  We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing... and nobody else. The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
</p>

<p>
  From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic as we deal with others.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 3: Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h3>

<p>
  I had listened intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.
</p>

<p>
  "Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention." ~ Jack Woodford
</p>

<p>
  I told him that I had been immensely entertained and instructed—and I had. I told him I wished I had his knowledge—and I did. I told him that I should love to wander the fields with him—and I have. I told him I must see him again—and I did. And so I had him thinking of me a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to talk.
</p>

<p>
  "There is no mystery about successful business intercourse... Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that." ~ Charles W. Eliot
</p>


<p>
  "Dr. Eliot's listening was not mere silence, but a form of activity. Sitting very erect on the end of his spine with hands joined in his lap, making no movement except that he revolved his thumbs around each other faster or slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to be hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He listened with his mind and attentively considered what you had to say while you said it ... At the end of an interview the person who had talked to him felt that he had had his say." ~ Henry James
</p>

<p>
  Even the most violent critic will frequently soften and be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic listener—a listener who will be silent while the irate fault-finder dilates like a king cobra and spews the poison out of his system.
</p>

<p>
  "They have been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open ... Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait." ~ Isaac F. Marcosson
</p>

<p>
  "Many persons call a doctor when all they want is an audience." ~ Reader's Digest
</p>

<p>
  When we are in trouble, all we want is a sympathetic listener to whom we can unburden ourselves. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.
</p>

<p>
  A man who met Freud described his manner of listening: "It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities which I had never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of the piercing 'soul penetrating gaze' business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary. You've no idea what it meant to be listened to like that."
</p>

<p>
  If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don't wait for him to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.
</p>

<p>
  Do you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the astonishing part of it is that some of them are prominent. Bores, that is all they are—bores intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their own importance.
</p>

<p>
  So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
</p>


<h3 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h3>

<p>
  Everyone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. And how was it done? The answer is simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.
</p>

<p>
  The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.
</p>

<p>
  Talking in terms of the other person's interests pays off for both parties.
</p>

<p>
  Principle 5: Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
</p>



<h3 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h3>

<p>
  If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.
</p>

<p>
  I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the incident is past.
</p>

<p>
  There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important.
</p>

<p>
  "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."
</p>

<p>
  You don't have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman of the Clambake Committee of your lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost every day.
</p>

<p>
  Little phrases such as 'I'm sorry to trouble you,' 'Would you be so kind be so kind as to - ?' 'Won't you please?' 'Would you mind?' 'Thank you'—little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life—and incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.
</p>

<p>
  Almost everyone considers himself important, very important. The life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important.
</p>
