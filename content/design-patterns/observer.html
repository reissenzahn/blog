<p>
  The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
</p>



<h3>Description</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>Subject</code> object manages some important data. The observers subscribe to be notified when the data in the subject changes. 
  </li>
  <li>
    The subject and observers thus define a one-to-many relationship. As the subject is the sole owner of that data, the observers are dependent on the subject to update them when the data changes. This results in a cleaner design than allowing many objects to control the same data. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Subjects implement the <code>Subject</code> interface which provides methods for objects to register and deregister as observers. Potential observers implement the <code>Observer</code> interface which has a single <code>update()</code> method that is called by the subject when its data changes.
  </li>
</ul>

A concrete subject always implements the Subject interface. In addition to the register and remove methods, the concrete subject implements a notifyObservers() method that is used to update all the current observers whenever state changes.

The concrete subject may also have methods for setting and getting its state (more about this later).

---

 Observers are loosely coupled
in that the Subject knows
nothing about them, other
than that they implement the
Observer interface.

The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements the Observer interface. We can add and remove observers without because the only thing the subject depends on is a list of objects that implement the Observer interface. We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers. 



<h3>Example</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    We consider the case of an internet-based weather monitoring station.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a <code>WeatherData</code> object which tracks current weather conditions and provides getter functions to return the most recent temperature, humidity and pressure measurements as well as a <code>measurementsChange()</code> method that is called every time the measurements change.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need to build an application that provides display elements for the current conditions, weather statistics and a simple forecast. All the display elements must be updated in real time as the <code>WeatherData</code> object acquires new measurements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Further, we need to allow other developers to extend the application by writing their own weather display elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    A misguided implementation would be to add code to <code>measurementsChanged()</code> that invokes an <code>update()</code> method on instances of each of the display element classes with the most recent measurements. But then we would have to alter the code for every new display element and there would be no way to add display elements at runtime.
  </li>
</ul>


The WeatherData class certainly has state...that’s the temperature,
humidity, and barometric pressure, and those definitely change.

Mary: Yup, and when those measurements change, we have to notify all the display elements
so they can do whatever it is they are going to do with the measurements.

If we make the WeatherData
object the subject, and the display elements the observers, then the displays will register
themselves with the WeatherData object in order to get the information they want, right?

Mary: Yes...and once the Weather Station knows about a display element, then it can just
call a method to tell it about the measurements.

Sue: We gotta remember that every display element can be different...so I think that’s where
having a common interface comes in. Even though every component has a different type,
they should all implement the same interface so that the WeatherData object will know how
to send them the measurements.

Mary: I see what you mean. So every display will have, say, an update() method that
WeatherData will call.
Sue: And update() is defined in a common interface that all the elements implement…


All our weather components implement the Observer interface. This gives the Subject a common interface to talk to when it comes time to update the observers.

Let’s also create an interface
for all display elements
to implement. The display
elements just need to
implement a display() method.

---

public interface Observer {
  public void update(float temp, float humidity, float pressure);
 }

 The Observer interface
is implemented by all
observers, so they all
have to implement the
update() method.

These are the state values the Observers get from
the Subject when a weather measurement changes.


---

In our current Weather Station design, we are pushing all three pieces of data
to the update() method in the displays, even if the displays don’t need all these
values. That’s okay, but what if Weather-O-Rama adds another data value later,
like wind speed? Then we’ll have to change all the update() methods in all the
displays, even if most of them don’t need or want the wind speed data.
Now, whether we pull or push the data to the Observer is an implementation
detail, but in a lot of cases it makes sense to let Observers retrieve the data they
need rather than passing more and more data to them through the update()
method. After all, over time, this is an area that may change and grow unwieldy.
And, we know CEO Johnny Hurricane is going to want to expand the Weather
Station and sell more displays, so let’s take another pass at the design and see if
we can make it even easier to expand in the future.
Updating the Weather Station code to allow Observers to pull the data they
need is a pretty straightforward exercise. All we need to do is make sure the
Subject has getter methods for its data, and then change our Observers to use
them to pull the data that’s appropriate for their needs. Let’s do that.

---

There’s another way of handling the data in the Subject: we can rely on the
Observers to pull it from the Subject as needed. Right now, when the Subject’s data
changes, we push the new values for temperature, humidity, and pressure to the
Observers, by passing that data in the call to update().
Let’s set things up so that when an Observer is notified of a change, it calls getter
methods on the Subject to pull the values it needs.
To switch to using pull, we need to make a few small changes to our existing code. 

We’ll modify the notifyObservers() method in WeatherData to call the method
update() in the Observers with no arguments:

And finally, we modify each concrete Observer to change the signature of its respective
update() methds and get the weather data from the Subject using the WeatherData’s
getter methods. Here’s the new code for the CurrentConditionsDisplay class:

<h3>Principle: Loose Coupling</h3>

<p>
  <i>
    Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
  </i>
</p>


<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact but they typically have very little knowledge of each other.

Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

Loosely coupled designs often give us a lot of flexibility.





Let’s say
we have a new concrete class come along that needs to be an observer. We don’t need
to make any changes to the subject to accommodate the new class type; all we have
to do is implement the Observer interface in the new class and register as an observer.
The subject doesn’t care; it will deliver notifications to any object that implements the
Observer interface.
We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other. If we have
another use for a subject or an observer, we can easily reuse them because the two aren’t
tightly coupled.
Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other.
Because the two are loosely coupled, we are free to make changes to either, as long as the
objects still meet their obligations to implement the Subject or Observer interfaces.
