<p>
  The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object. Each decorator has an instance variable that holds a reference to a the object it decorates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each decorator adds its own behavior before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job. Decorators can also add new methods and extend the state of the component.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate so we can pass around a decorated object in place of the original wrapped object.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can decorate objects dynamically at runtime as, while we use inheritance to achieve type matching, we acquire new behavior by composing objects together.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    We consider the case of a coffee shop that sells a wide variety of beverages as well as condiments for those beverages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>Beverage</code> abstract class is subclassed by all beverages and has an abstract <code>cost()</code> method that each subclass implements to return the cost of the beverage.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we simply subclass <code>Beverage</code> to account for the costs of the various condiments then we will end up with a class explosion: <code>EspressoWithStreamedMilkAndMocha</code>, <code>HouseBlendWithSteamedMilkAndWhip</code>,etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    We could add instance variables to the Beverage class like <code>withMocha</code> and <code>withWhip</code>. The <code>cost()</code> method in <code>Beverage</code> could then calculate the costs for all of the condiments, while the overridden <code>cost()</code> in the subclasses could extend that functionality to include the cost of the specific beverage.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, this would force us to alter the <code>cost()</code> method in <code>Beverage</code> each time condiment prices change or new condiments are added. Also some condiments may not be appropriate for certain beverages. And what if a customer orders a double mocha?
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead, we will start with a beverage and decorate it with condiments at runtime. For instance, we might start with a <code>Espresso</code> object, decorate it with a <code>Mocha</code> object and then decorate it with a <code>Whip</code> object.
  </li>
  <li>
    This way, we get a <code>Espresso</code> object wrapped in <code>Mocha</code> and <code>Whip</code> objects. The <code>Mocha</code> and <code>Whip</code> types mirror the <code>Beverage</code> type so we can treat the wrapped object as a <code>Beverage</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    When we call the <code>cost()</code> method we will rely on delegation to add up the condiment costs. Calling <code>cost()</code> on the <code>Whip</code> object will call <code>cost()</code> on the <code>Mocha</code> object which will call <code>cost()</code> on the <code>Espresso</code> object. This gives us a whole lot more flexibility about how to mix and match condiments and beverages.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Principle: Open-Closed</h3>

<p>
  <i>
    Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  </i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We often spend a lot of time getting certain code correct and so we do not want to alter existing code. However, by allowing extension we can still allow for new behavior to be added as requirements change.
  </li>
  <li>
    This leads to designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    We must carefully identify that areas of code that need to be extended as trying to apply the Open-Closed Principle everywhere is wasteful and can lead to greater complexity by introducing new levels of abstraction.
  </li>
</ul>
