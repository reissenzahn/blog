<p>
  The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<!-- 
Having a common interface for your aggregates is handy for your client; it decouples your client from the implementation of your collection of objects.

The ConcreteAggregate
has a collection of
objects and implements
the method that
returns an Iterator for
its collection.

The Iterator interface
provides the interface
that all iterators
must implement, and
a set of methods
for traversing over elements of a collection. 

Each
ConcreteAggregate
is responsible for
instantiating a
ConcreteIterator that
can iterate over its
collection of objects.

The ConcreteIterator is
responsible for managing
the current position of
the iteration.

---

  The hasNext() method returns a boolean indicating whether or not there are more elements to iterate over...
To add an iterator to the DinerMenu, we first need to define the Iterator interface:
...and the next() method
returns the next element.


You’ve already seen how to implement the Iterator
Pattern with your very own iterator. You’ve also seen
how Java supports iterators in some of its collectionoriented classes (ArrayList). Now it’s time to check out
the official definition of the pattern:
This makes a lot of sense: the pattern gives you a way
to step through the elements of an aggregate without
having to know how things are represented under the
covers. You’ve seen that with the two implementations
of Menus. But the effect of using iterators in your design
is just as important: once you have a uniform way of
accessing the elements of all your aggregate objects, you
can write polymorphic code that works with any of these
aggregates—just like the printMenu() method, which
doesn’t care if the menu items are held in an Array or
ArrayList (or anything else that can create an Iterator), as
long as it can get hold of an Iterator.
The other important impact on your design is that the
Iterator Pattern takes the responsibility of traversing
elements and gives that responsibility to the iterator
object, not the aggregate object. This not only keeps
the aggregate interface and implementation simpler,
it removes the responsibility for iteration from the
aggregate and keeps the aggregate focused on the
things it should be focused on (managing a collection of
objects), not on iteration.

The Iterator Pattern
allows traversal of the
elements of an aggregate
without exposing the
underlying implementation.

It also places the task
of traversal on the
iterator object, not
on the aggregate,
which simplifies the
aggregate interface and
implementation, and
places the responsibility
where it should be.

<h3>Example</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    We consider the case of a restaurant with separate breakfast and lunch menus. The implementation of the breakfast menu uses an ArrayList to hold <code>MenuItem</code> instances while the lunch menu uses an array. We have too much dependent code to modify these implementations to use the same collection.
  </li>
  <li>
    We want to implement an automated waitress that is able to print all menu items. Now, we could approach this by simply calling a <code>getMenuItems()</code> method on each menu and then using a loop to iterate over the <code>ArrayList</code> as well as a second loop to iterate over the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, this would means we would be coding to the concrete <code>BreakfastMenu</code> and <code>LunchMenu</code> implementations and the <code>Waitress</code> would need to know how about the internal collections used by the menu classes which violates encapsulation. If the <code>BreakfastMenu</code> was modified to use a different collection then we would have to modify code in <code>Waitress</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead, we will encapsulate the iteration by providing each menu class with a concrete iterator class which implements the <code>Iterator</code> interface. The menu classes have a <code>createIterator()</code> method which returns the suitable iterator instance. The iterators encapsulate the way we iterate through a collection of objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>Waitress</code> class can then use <code>Iterator</code> interfaces rather than concrete classes which insulates it from the internal details of how <code>MenuItem</code> instances are maintained in the menu classes. It can also looping code that polymorphically handles any class that implements <code>Iterator</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
The Menu interfaces are now exactly
the same and, uh oh, we still don’t
have a common interface, which
means the Waitress is still bound to
two concrete Menu classes. We’d
better fix that.

<h3>Principle: Single Responsibility</h3>

<p>
  <i>
    A class should have only one reason to change.
  </i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<!-- 
What if we allowed our aggregates to implement their internal
collections and related operations AND the iteration methods?
Well, we already know that would expand the number of
methods in the aggregate, but so what? Why is that so bad?
Well, to see why, you first need to recognize that when we allow
a class to not only take care of its own business (managing
some kind of aggregate) but also take on more responsibilities
(like iteration) then we’ve given the class two reasons to change.
Two? Yup, two: it can change if the collection changes in some
way, and it can change if the way we iterate changes. So once
again our friend CHANGE is at the center of another design
principle:


We know we want to avoid change in our classes because
modifying code provides all sorts of opportunities for
problems to creep in. Having two ways to change increases
the probability the class will change in the future, and when
it does, it’s going to affect two aspects of your design.
The solution? The principle guides us to assign each
responsibility to one class, and only one class.
That’s right, it’s as easy as that, and then again it’s not:
separating responsibility in design is one of the most
difficult things to do. Our brains are just too good at seeing
a set of behaviors and grouping them together even when
there are actually two or more responsibilities. The only
way to succeed is to be diligent in examining your designs
and to watch out for signals that a class is changing in more
than one way as your system grows.

Every responsibility of
a class is an area of
potential change. More
than one responsibility
means more than one area
of change.
This principle guides us to
keep each class to a single
responsibility.

Cohesion is a term you’ll
hear used as a measure of
how closely a class or a
module supports a single
purpose or responsibility.
We say that a module or
class has high cohesion when it
is designed around a set of related
functions, and we say it has low
cohesion when it is designed around a
set of unrelated functions.
Cohesion is a more general concept
than the Single Responsibility Principle,
but the two are closely related.
Classes that adhere to the principle
tend to have high cohesion and are
more maintainable than classes that
take on multiple responsibilities and
have low cohesion.
