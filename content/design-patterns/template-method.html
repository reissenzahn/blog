<p>
  The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton
  of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
  subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
  certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
  algorithm’s structure.
</p>

<!-- 
  The Template Method defines the steps of an algorithm and allows
subclasses to provide the implementation for one or more steps.
 -->


<h3>Description</h3>

<!-- 
We’re going to get down to encapsulating
pieces of algorithms so that subclasses can hook themselves right into a
computation anytime they want.

This pattern is all about creating a template for an algorithm. What’s a template?
As you’ve seen it’s just a method; more specifically, it’s a method that defines an
algorithm as a set of steps. One or more of these steps is defined to be abstract and
implemented by a subclass. This ensures the algorithm’s structure stays unchanged,
while subclasses provide some part of the implementation.


---

The AbstractClass
contains the template
method...
...and abstract versions
of the operations
used in the template
method.

The template method makes use of the
primitive operations to implement an
algorithm. It is decoupled from the actual
implementation of these operations.

The ConcreteClass implements
the abstract operations,
which are called when the templateMethod() needs them.

There may be many
ConcreteClasses, each
implementing the full set of
operations required by the
template method.

We also have a concrete operation
defined in the abstract class. This
could be overridden by subclasses, or we
could prevent overriding by declaring
concreteOperation() as final. More about
this in a bit...

---

A hook is a method that is declared in the
abstract class, but only given an empty or default
implementation. This gives subclasses the ability to
“hook into” the algorithm at various points, if they
wish; a subclass is also free to ignore the hook. 
-->

<!-- 
  Q: When I’m creating a template method, how do I know when
to use abstract methods and when to use hooks?
A: Use abstract methods when your subclass MUST provide an
implementation of the method or step in the algorithm. Use hooks
when that part of the algorithm is optional. With hooks, a subclass
may choose to implement that hook, but it doesn’t have to.
Q: What are hooks really supposed to be used for?
A: There are a few uses of hooks. As we just said, a hook may
provide a way for a subclass to implement an optional part of an
algorithm, or if it isn’t important to the subclass’s implementation, it
can skip it. Another use is to give the subclass a chance to react to
some step in the template method that is about to happen or just
happened. For instance, a hook method like justReorderedList()
allows the subclass to perform some activity (such as redisplaying an
onscreen representation) after an internal list is reordered. As you’ve
seen, a hook can also provide a subclass with the ability to make a
decision for the abstract class.
Q: Does a subclass have to implement all the abstract
methods in the AbstractClass?
A: Yes, each concrete subclass defines the entire set of abstract
methods and provides a complete implementation of the undefined
steps of the template method’s algorithm.
Q: It seems like I should keep my abstract methods small in
number; otherwise, it will be a big job to implement them in the
subclass.
A: That’s a good thing to keep in mind when you write template
methods. Sometimes you can do this by not making the steps of
your algorithm too granular. But it’s obviously a tradeoff: the less
granularity, the less flexibility.
Remember, too, that some steps will be optional, so you can
implement these as hooks rather than abstract methods, easing the
burden on the subclasses of your abstract class.

<h3>Example</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    We consider the case of a coffee shop with standardized recipes for making coffee and tea.
  </li>
  <li>
    The coffee recipe is: 1) Boil some water, 2) Brew coffee in boiling water, 3) Pour coffee in cup, 4) Add sugar and milk. The tea recipe is similar: 1) Boil some water, 2) Steep tea in boiling water, 3) Pour tea in cup, 4) Add lemon.
  </li>
  <li>
    We create Coffee and Tea classes and in each class we implement each preparation step as a separate method as well as a prepareRecipe() method that invokes these methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    We notice that there are boilWater() and pourInCup() methods that are duplicated across the classes and so we define an abstract CaffeineBeverage class that declares an abstract prepareRecipe() method and provides implementations for the duplicated methods. The Coffee and Tea classes can then subclass CaffeineBeverage, include their specific methods and override prepareRecipe().
  </li>
  <li>
    However, there is another commonality which is that both recipes essentially follow the same algorithm. As such, we move to abstracting prepareRecipe() from each subclass.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Coffee class uses brewCoffeeGrinds() and addSugarAndMilk() methods while the Tea class uses steepTeaBag() and addLemon() methods. Steeping and brewing are pretty analogous so we will use a new brew() method in either case. Similarly, we will replace addSugarAndMilk() and addLemon() with addCondiments().
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, we add the generalized brew() and addCondiments() to the CaffeineBeverage class and also move the prepareRecipe() method to CaffeineBeverage with an implementation that invokes the generalized methods. We declare the prepareRecipe() method as final to prevent it from being overridden.
  </li>
  <li>
    As such, we have recognized that the two recipes are essentially the same although some o the steps require different implementations. So we have generalized the recipe and TODO

    Caffeine Beverage knows and controls the steps of the recipe, and performs steps 1 and 3 itself, but relies on Tea or Coffee to do steps 2 and 4.
  </li>
</ul>


<!-- 
 In the template, each
step of the algorithm is
represented by a method.
prepareRecipe() is our
template method. Why?
Because:
 (1) It is a method, after all.
 (2) It serves as a template for an algorithm—in this case, an algorithm for making caffeinated beverages.
Some methods are
handled by this class...
...and some are handled
by the subclass.
The methods that need to
be supplied by a subclass are
declared abstract.

 -->


<!--
Initially, code was duplicated across Coffee and Tea and changes to the algorithm required opening the subclasses and making multiple changes.

Now, the CaffeineBeverage class maximizes reuse among the subclasses. The algorithm lives in one place and code changes only need to be made there.

The CaffeineBeverage class
concentrates knowledge about the
algorithm and relies on subclasses to
provide complete implementations.

The Template Method Pattern provides
a framework that other caffeine
beverages can be plugged into. New
caffeine beverages only need to
implement a couple of methods.
 -->

<!--
  We’ve added a little conditional
statement that bases its
success on a concrete method,
customerWantsCondiments(). If the
customer WANTS condiments, only then
do we call addCondiments().

Here we’ve defined a method with a (mostly) empty default implementation. This method just returns true and does nothing else.
This is a hook because the
subclass can override this
method, but doesn’t have to.

To use the hook, we override it in our subclass. Here, the hook controls whether
the CaffeineBeverage class evaluates a certain part of the algorithm—that is,
whether it adds a condiment to the beverage.
How do we know whether the customer wants the condiment? Just ask!
-->



<h3>Principle: Hollywood Principle</h3>

<p>
  <i>Don't call use, we'll call you.</i>
</p>


<!-- 
The Hollywood Principle gives us a way to prevent “dependency rot.” 

Dependency rot happens when you have high-level components depending on low-level components depending on high-level components depending on sideways components depending on low-level components, and so on. When rot sets in, no one can easily understand the way a system is designed.

With the Hollywood Principle, we allow low-level components to hook themselves into a system, but the high-level components determine when they are needed, and how.

In other words, the high-level components give the low-level components the “don’t call us, we’ll call you” treatment.


Low-level components can participate in the computation but the high-level components control when and how. A low-level component never calls a high-level component directly.


For instance, the CaffeineBeverage is the high-level component.  It has control over the algorithm for the recipe, and calls on the subclasses only when they’re needed for an implementation of a method.

Tea and Coffee never call the abstract class directly without being “called” first.

Clients of beverages will depend
on the CaffeineBeverage
abstraction rather than a
concrete Tea or Coffee, which
reduces dependencies in the
overall system
How does the Hollywood Principle relate to the
Dependency Inversion Principle that we learned a few chapters
back?


The Hollywood Principle is a technique for building
frameworks or components so that lower-level components can be
hooked into the computation, but without creating dependencies
between the lower-level components and the higher-level layers.

A low-level component will often end up
calling a method defined above it in the inheritance hierarchy purely
through inheritance. But we want to avoid creating explicit circular
dependencies between the low-level component and the high-level
ones.

Q: Is this really the Template Method Pattern, or are you
trying too hard?
A: The pattern calls for implementing an algorithm and letting
subclasses supply the implementation of the steps—and the Arrays
sort() is clearly not doing that! But, as we know, patterns in the
wild aren’t always just like the textbook patterns. They have to be
modified to fit the context and implementation constraints.
The designers of the Arrays sort() method had a few constraints. In
general, you can’t subclass a Java array and they wanted the sort to
be used on all arrays (and each array is a different class). So they
defined a static method and deferred the comparison part of the
algorithm to the items being sorted.
So, while it’s not a textbook template method, this implementation is
still in the spirit of the Template Method Pattern. Also, by eliminating
the requirement that you have to subclass Arrays to use this
algorithm, they’ve made sorting in some ways more flexible and
useful.
Q: This implementation of sorting actually seems more like
the Strategy Pattern than the Template Method Pattern. Why do
we consider it Template Method?
A: You’re probably thinking that because the Strategy Pattern uses
object composition. You’re right in a way—we’re using the Arrays
object to sort our array, so that’s similar to Strategy. But remember,
in Strategy, the class that you compose with implements the
entire algorithm. The algorithm that Arrays implements for sort() is
incomplete; it needs a class to fill in the missing compareTo() method.
So, in that way, it’s more like Template Method.
Q: Are there other examples of template methods in the Java
API?
A: Yes, you’ll find them in a few places. For example, java.io has a
read() method in InputStream that subclasses must implement and is
used by the template method read(byte b[], int off, int len).

Hey, that does sound a lot like what I do. But my
intent’s a little different from yours; my job is to
define the outline of an algorithm, but let my
subclasses do some of the work. That way, I can
have different implementations of an algorithm’s
individual steps, but keep control over the
algorithm’s structure. Seems like you have to give up
control of your algorithms.

 The Hollywood Principle guides us
to put decision making in highlevel modules that can decide
how and when to call low-level
modules.
 You’ll see lots of uses of the

real-world code, but (as with any
pattern) don’t expect it all to be
designed “by the book.”
 The Strategy and Template
