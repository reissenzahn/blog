    "Data dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structure and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming."

<blockquote>

    "The practice is pervaded by the reassuring illusion that programs are just devices like any others, the only difference admitted being that their manufacture might require a new type of craftsmen, viz. programmers. From there it is only a small step to measuring 'programmer productivity' in terms of 'number of lines of code produced per month'. This is a very costly measuring unit because it is encouraging the writing of insipid code, but today I am less interested in how foolish a unit it is from even a pure business point of view. My point today is that, if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as 'lines produced' but as 'lines spent': the current conventional wisdom is so foolish as to book that count on the wrong side of the ledger."

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."

    "There's a very fine line between sleazy and elegant... often sleaze that you get away with is actually elegance."

  <p>
    "I’m always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done. Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler. Who'd have guessed sophistication brought such noise?"

    "You know, I know this ThinkPad doesn't exist. I know that when I put my finger on the TrackPoint, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is rugged and responsive. After nine years, you know what I realize? The X200 is bliss."

    "The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves."
