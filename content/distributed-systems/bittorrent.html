<ul>
  <li>
    BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that redistributes upload costs among downloaders by having them upload pieces of the file to each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    This offers scalability and affordability advantages over a traditional client-server architecture which places all the upload cost on the file host.
  </li>
  <li>
    BitTorrent consists of two logically distinct protocols:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <i>tracker HTTP protocol</i> defines a method for contacting a tracker for purposes such as joining a swarm and reporting progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <i>peer wire protocol</i> defines a mechanism for communication between peers in order to share a file content.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A torrent is published by establishing a tracker, creating a metainfo file from the torrent pointing to the tracker, publishing that metainfo file and setting up a seeder.
  </li>
  <li>
    A client downloads a torrent by retrieving the metainfo file, periodically requesting swarm information from the tracker and connecting to peers in the swarm to share pieces.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>
  <i>Peer</i>: A node in a network participating in file sharing. Can simultaneously act as both a client and a server.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Neighboring peers</i>: Peers with which a client has an active TCP connection. 
</p>

<p>
  <i>Client</i>: A user agent that acts as a peer on behalf of a user.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Seeder</i>: A peer that has a complete copy of a torrent.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Leecher</i>: A peer that does not have a complete copy of the torrent.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Swarm</i>: The network of peers sharing a given torrent.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Torrent</i>: The file or group of files (multi-file torrent) that is being shared.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Tracker</i>: A centralized server that keeps track of torrents and the participating peers in their associated swarms.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Scraping</i>: When a client sends a request to a tracker for information about a torrent.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Snubbing</i>: A client considers itself as snubbed by a peer if it has not received any data from that peer in over 60 seconds.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Metainfo file</i>: A text file that holds information about the torrent and the URL of the suitable tracker. Usually has the <code>.torrent</code> extension.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Peer Identifier</i>: A unique 20-byte string that identifiers a peer.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Info Hash</i>: A SHA-1 hash calculated from data in a metainfo file that uniquely identifies the torrent described by that metainfo file.

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<h4>Pieces and Hashes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    A torrent is treated as a contiguous stream of bytes which is divided into a number of fixed-size pieces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Torrents consisting of multi-files are considered as the concatenation of these files in the order of their appearance in the metainfo file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each piece is assigned a sequential index starting from zero. The last piece may be smaller than the rest.
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of pieces and the SHA-1 hashes of each piece are included in the metainfo file to verify the integrity of each downloaded piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    Too large piece sizes result in less efficient transfers while too small piece sizes cause large metainfo files. Typical sizes include 256KB, 512Kb and 1MB.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer can only share the complete pieces it has obtained. The complete torrent is obtained by combining all the pieces into a single string of bytes.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Pipelining</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    When distributing pieces between peers, those pieces are further broken down into blocks so as to allow a peer to download a given piece from multiple peers. Typical client implementations use a block size of 16KB.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a peer has downloaded a complete piece, it can verify its integrity by computing its SHA-1 hash and then immediately start sharing it with other peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    By breaking pieces into blocks, BitTorrent facilitates always keeping some number (typically five) of requests pipelined at once. Each time a block arrives, a new request is sent.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is very important when transferring data over TCP as having several requests pending at once avoids a delay between blocks being sent.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Trackers</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    A tracker is a centralized server that keeps track of torrents and the peers in their associated swarms.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tracker is not directly involved in data transfer and does not hold copies of torrents.
  </li>
  <li>
    A client contacts a tracker using the announce URL specified in the metainfo file in order to join the swarm.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clients periodically report information to the tracker and in exchange receive information about other peers to which they can connect to download pieces.
  </li>
  <li>
    A tracker relies on peers sending regular requests and may otherwise assume that a peer is dead.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Metainfo Files</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    To publish a file using BitTorrent, a metainfo file containing information about the torrent must be created.
  </li>
  <li>
    This includes tracker information, the piece length, hashes for each piece and metadata about the torrent.
  </li>
  <li>
    These hashes will be used keep track of which pieces each peer has and to verify the integrity of each piece a peer obtains.
  </li>
  <li>
    The metainfo file can then be distributed to peers interested in downloading the file.
  </li>
  <li>
    At least one seeder with access to the complete torrent must be made available to allow for the file to start being distributed.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Piece Selection</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    The method used to select which pieces to begin downloading is very important for ensuring high performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Three policies are used for piece selection:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Strict Priority</i>: Once a block for a particular piece has been requested, the remaining blocks for that piece are requested before blocks from any other piece to ensure that complete pieces are obtained as quickly as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Rarest First</i>: When selecting which piece to start downloading next, peers generally download pieces which the fewest of their own peers have first. This replicates the rarest pieces as quickly as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Random First Piece</i>: When downloading starts, pieces to download are selected at random until a complete piece is obtained. This looks to ensure that peers get a piece to upload as quickly as possible rather than attempting to obtain rare pieces which will generally download slower.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    To find the rarest piece a client must calculate for each piece index the number of times this index is true in the bitfield vectors of all the neighboring peers. The piece with the lowest sum is then selected for requesting.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Endgame Mode</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sometimes a piece will be requested from a peer with very slow transfer rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is not a problem in the middle of a download but could delay a download that is just about to finish.
  </li>
  <li>
    To prevent this, once all blocks which a peer does not have are actively being requested, it enters <i>endgame mode</i> and sends requests for all of the missing blocks to all peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cancels are sent for blocks which arrive to prevent redundant sends.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Choking</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Each peer is responsible for attempting to maximize its own download rate. Peers achieve this by downloading from whichever peers they can and deciding which peers to upload to using a variant of tit-for-tat.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer either uploads to cooperate or <i>chokes</i> to not cooperate. Choking consists of a temporary refusal to upload though downloading can still happen and the connection does not need to be renegotiated when choking stops.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer always unchokes a fixed number of other peers (default is four) and the decision as to which peers to unchoke is strictly based on current download rates as measured by, say, a 20-second rolling average.
  </li>
  <li>
    Peers calculate who they want to choke only once every rechoke period (10 seconds) to avoid wasting resources by rapidly choking and unchoking peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to discover if currently unused connections might provide better download rates than the ones currently being used, a peer also has a single <i>optimistic unchoke</i> which is unchoked regardless of the current download rate. The peer that is the optimistic unchoke is rotated every third rechoke period (30 seconds).
  </li>
  <li>
    If a peer is choked by all peers which it was formerly downloading from it will usually get poor download rates until the optimistic unchoke finds better peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    To mitigate this, if a minute passes without a peer receiving a piece from a particular peer then it will assume it has been <i>snubbed</i> and stops uploading to that peer (except if it becomes optimistic unchoke). The peer will then increase the number of optimistic unchokes in order to find better peers faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once a peer is done downloading, it no longer has useful download rates to decide which peers to upload to and so might decide to prefer peers which which it has better upload rates or those peers which no-one else happens to be uploading to at the moment.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- 
  Occasionally a BitTorrent peer will be choked by all peers which it was formerly downloading from. In such cases it will usually continue to get poor download rates until the optimistic unchoke finds better peers. To mitigate this problem, when over a minute goes by without getting any piece data while downloading from a peer, BitTorrent assumes it is "snubbed" by that peer and doesn't upload to it except as an optimistic unchoke. This frequently results in more than one concurrent optimistic unchoke, (an exception to the exactly one optimistic unchoke rule mentioned above), which causes download rates to recover much more quickly when they falter.

  To mitigate this problem, when over a minute goes by without getting a single piece from a particular peer, BitTorrent assumes it is ’snubbed’ by that peer and doesn’t upload to it except as an optimistic unchoke. This frequently results in more than one concurrent optimistic unchoke, (an exception to the exactly one optimistic unchoke rule mentioned above), which causes download rates to recover much more quickly when they falter.

   If a client hasn’t got anything from a particular peer for 60 seconds, it
presumes that is has been “snubbed”. Following the mentality of “tit-for-tat” it retaliates and
refuses to upload to that peer (except if it becomes an optimistic unchoke). It will then
increase the number of optimistic unchokes in order to try to find new connections quicker. 
 -->


<h4>Peer State</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    A client must maintain the following state information for each connection with a remote peer:
    <ul>
      <li>
        am_choking: Is the client choking the peer? (default=1)
      </li>
      <li>
        am_interested: Is the client interested in requesting data from the peer? (default=0)
      </li>
      <li>
        peer_choking: Is the peer choking the client? (default=1)
      </li>
      <li>
        peer_interested: Is the peer interested in requesting data from the client? (default=0)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When a peer is choked, it is a notification that no requests will be answered until the peer is unchoked. The peer should not attempt to send any data-oriented messaged. If a peer chokes a remote peer, it must discard any unanswered requests for blocks previously received from the remote peer.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a peer indicates its interest in another peer, it is a notification that the remote peer will begin requesting blocks when the client unchokes them. It is important for a peer to keep its peers informed as to whether or not it is interested in them even when the client is choked.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region tracker-http-protocol -->
<h3 id="tracker-http-protocol">Tracker HTTP Protocol</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    A tracker is an HTTP service which receives GET requests that include metrics from clients and responds with a peer list that allows a peer to participate in the torrent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client requests are sent to the announce URL specified in the metainfo file and various parameters are specified in the query string.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tracker responds with a <code>text/plain</code> document consisting of a bencoded dictionary.

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region peer-wire-protocol -->
<h3 id="peer-wire-protocol">Peer Wire Protocol</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The peer wire protocol consists of the asynchronous exchange of length-prefixed messages over TCP.
  </li>
  <li>
    Peer connections are symmetrical. Messages sent in both directions look the same and data can flow in either direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    State-oriented messages inform peers of state changes and must be sent whenever a change occurs in the state of a peer. Data-oriented messages handle transferring blocks between peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    All messages (excluding the <code>handshake</code> and <code>keep-alive</code> messages) are prefixed with a four byte big-endian value indicating the message length and a message ID consisting of a single decimal byte.
  </li>
  <li>
    All integers are encoded as four byte big-endian values.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Handshake</h4>

{{% code text %}}handshake: <pstrlen=19><pstr="BitTorrent protocol"><reserved><info_hash><peer_id>{{% /code %}}

  <ul>
    <li>
      Should a given peer want to communicate with another peer, it must start by opening a TCP connection and perform a handshake consisting of an exchange of handshake messages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The handshake message specifies the 20 byte SHA-1 hash of the <code>info</code> key in the metainfo file in the <code>info_hash</code> field. 
    </li>
    <li>
      The <code>pstrlen</code> field is a byte indicating the length of the protocol name in the <code>pstr</code> field. The <code>peer_id</code> specifies a 20 byte self-designated unique identifier for the peer. The <code>reserved</code> field contains eight bytes typically set to zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a peer receives a handshake with an <code>info_hash</code> that it is not current serving then it must drop the connection. Also, if the initiating peer receives a handshake in which the <code>peer_id</code> does not match the expected <code>peer_id</code> (as received from the tracker) then it is expected to drop the connection.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>State-Oriented Messages</h4>

{{% code text %}}choke: <len=0001><id=0>
unchoke: <len=0001><id=1>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    A peer sends a <code>choke</code> message to a peer to inform it that it is being choked.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer sends an <code>unchoke</code> message to a peer to inform it that it is no longer being choked.
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code text %}}interested: <len=0001><id=2>
uninterested: <len=0001><id=3>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    A peer sends an interested message to a peer to inform it of its desire to request blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer sends an uninterested message to inform it that it is not interested in any of its pieces.
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code text %}}have: <len=0005><id=4><piece_index>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    Once a peer has downloaded and validated a given piece it sends <code>have</code> messages to its peers with the index of the piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    A peer receiving this message must validate the index and drop the connection if this index is not within the expected bounds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise, it must send an <code>interested</code> message to the sender if it lacks the specified piece and may also send a request for that piece.
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code text %}}bitfield: <len=0001+X><id=5><bitfield>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    The bitfield message may only be sent immediately after the handshake is performed and before any other messages are sent.
  </li>
  <li>
    The payload is a bitfield representing the pieces that the sender has successfully downloaded with the high bit in the first byte corresponding to piece index 0. If a bit is cleared it is to be interpreted as a missing piece. Spare bits at the end are cleared.
  </li>
  <li>
    This message is optional and need not be sent if a client has no pieces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Peers should drop the connection if they receive bitfields that are not of the correct size or if the bitfield has any of the spare bits set.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Data-Oriented Messages</h4>

{{% code text %}}request: <len=0013><id=6><piece_index><block_offset><block_length>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    A request message is used to request a block. The piece index, block offset and block length indicate the block the sender is interested in downloading.
  </li>
  <li>
    The recipient must only send piece messages to a sender that has already requested it.
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code text %}}piece: <len=0009+X><id=7><piece_index><block_offset><block_data>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    The piece message is used to send a block of length X between peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The payload specifies the piece index, the block offset and the block data itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    The length is implicit and can be calculated by subtracting 9 from the total message length.  
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code text %}}cancel: <len=0013><id=8><piece_index><block_offset><block_length>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    During the end game, a peer may need to cancel block requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    The payload is the same as the request message and indicates the block within a piece that the peer has requested but is no longer interested in.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Keep Alive</h4>

{{% code text %}}keep-alive: <len=0000>{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    Peers may close a connection if they receive no messages for a certain period of time.
  </li>
  <li>
    A keep-alive message is then used to maintain a connection if no other messages have recently been sent.
  </li>
</ul>
