<ul>
  <li>
    A Merkel tree is a generalization of a hash list consisting of a tree of hashes in which each leaf node is labelled with the crypographic hash of a block of data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every internal node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the concatenation of the labels of its child node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Merkel trees allow for efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures while separating the validation of the data from the data itself.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    To construct a Merkel tree from some arbitrary data, we start by dividing the data into a number of blocks and computing cryptographic hashes of each of those blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usually, a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 though unsecured checksums can be used can be used if the hash tree only needs to protect against unintentional damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    The hashes of the data blocks are then used to label the leaf nodes of the Merkle tree. If there are an odd number of leaf nodes we can duplicate the last leaf node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving up the tree, we label each internal node with the hash of the sum of the hashes of its children. The hash held by the root node is referred to as the Merkle root.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Merkle Proofs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A merkle proof is used to assess the validity of a certain data block given a merkle root \(H_\text{trusted}\) obtained from a trusted authority. For example, to verify the inclusion of the block \(B_4\) in the case of <i>figure 2</i>, we only require the hashes \(H_3\), \(H_{12}\) and \(H_{5678}\). We proceed as follows: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Hash \(B_4\) to obtain \(H_4\).
  </li>
  <li>
    Hash \(H_3 + H_4\) to obtain \(H_{34}\).
  </li>
  <li>
    Hash \(H_{12} + H_{34}\) to obtain \(H_{1234}\).
  </li>
  <li>
    Hash \(H_{1234} + H_{5678}\) to obtain \(H_\text{root}\).
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare \(H_\text{root}\) to \(H_\text{trusted}\).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Given a large number of blocks, this approach requires distributing significantly fewer hashes than a hash list which would require sharing all the other hashes. Verifying any single content entry in the tree will require only \(n \log2(n)\) steps in the worst case.
</p>


<h3>File Integrity</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To verify a file shared over the network we can include the hash of the file and have the user compare the hash of the downloaded file to this hash. However, should the hashes not match, the user will need to restart the entire download. Instead, we can break the file into blocks and use the hashes of those blocks to construct a Merkle tree. The user can then verify the downloaded file using the Merkle root as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Compare the Merkle root to the hash of the downloaded file.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the hashes don't match at least one of the blocks must be corrupted so request the hashes of the child nodes of the root.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare the received hashes to the hashes of the appropriate blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    If any hashes don't match request the hashes of the child nodes of the corresponding nodes in the Merkle tree.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this process until the base of the tree has been reached and the corrupted blocks have been identified and re-downloaded.
  </li>
</ul>
