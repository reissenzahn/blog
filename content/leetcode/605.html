<h3 id="question">Question</h3>

<p>
  You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
</p>

<p>
  Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
</p>

{{% code makefile %}}Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false{{% /code %}}


<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>
  We advance through the array and place a flower each time the previous, current and next elements are all zero (or off the edge of the array). If these conditions hold we place a flower in the current position and advance two spaces as the next position cannot be used to hold a flower; otherwise, we simple advance one position.

  public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {

    // we can trivially plant 0 flowers
    if (n == 0) return true;

    for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
      if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i - 1 < 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i + 1 >= flowerbed.length || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        n--;

        // next position cannot hold a flower
        i++;

        if (n == 0) return true;
      }
    }

    return false;
