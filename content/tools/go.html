  PACKAGES

Go code is organize d into packages, which are simi lar
to librar ies or modules in other langu ages. A package consists of one or more .go source files
in a single direc tor y that define what the package does. Each source file beg ins with a package
de clarat ion, here package main, that states which package the file belongs to, followed by a list
of other packages that it imports, and then the declarat ions of the program that are stored in
that file.

Package main is speci al. It defines a standalone executable program, not a librar y. Within
package main the function main is also speci al—it’s where execution of the program beg ins.
Whatever main do es is what the program does. Of course, main wi l l normal ly cal l upon functions
in other packages to do much of the work, such as the function fmt.Println.


Go uses the case of the first letter in the name of a package-level declaration to determine if the item is accessible outside the
package.


FORMAT

Printf has over a dozen such conversions, which Go programmers cal l verbs. This table is far
from a complete specification but illustrates many of the features that are avai lable:

%d decimal integer
%x, %o, %b integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary
%f, %g, %e floating-point number: 3.141593 3.141592653589793 3.141593e+00
%t boole an: true or false
%c rune (Unicode co de point)
%s string
%q quoted string "abc" or rune 'c'
%v any value in a natural format
%T type of any value
%% literal percent sig n (no operand)

<!-- 
  Whenever a for-range loop encounters a multi-byte rune in a string, it converts the UTF-8 representation into a single 32-bit number and assigns it to the value. The offset is incremented by the number of bytes in the rune. If the for-range loop encounters a byte that doesn’t represent a valid UTF-8 value, the Unicode replacement character (hex value 0xfffd) is returned instead.

<!-- 
UTF-8

UTF-8 lets you use a single byte to represent the Unicode characters whose values are below 128 (which includes all of the letters, numbers, and punctuation commonly used in English), but expands to a maximum of four bytes to represent Unicode code points with larger values. The result is that the worst case for
UTF-8 is the same as using UTF-32.

You also don’t have to worry about little-endian versus big-endian. It also allows you to look at any byte in a sequence and tell if you are at the start of a
UTF-8 sequence, or somewhere in the middle.

The only downside is that you cannot randomly access a string encoded with UTF-8. While you can detect if you are in the middle of a character, you can’t tell how many characters in you are. You need to start at the beginning of the string and count.

Go doesn’t require a string to be written in UTF-8, but it strongly encourages it.

Rather than use the slice and index expressions with strings, you should extract substrings and code points from strings using the functions in the strings and unicode/utf8 packages in the standard library.

CHANNEL OWNERSHIP

The first thing we should do to put channels in the right context is to assign channel
ownership. I’ll define ownership as being a goroutine that instantiates, writes, and
closes a channel. Much like memory in languages without garbage collection, it’s
important to clarify which goroutine owns a channel in order to reason about our
programs logically. Unidirectional channel declarations are the tool that will allow us
to distinguish between goroutines that own channels and those that only utilize them:
channel owners have a write-access view into the channel (chan or chan<-), and
channel utilizers only have a read-only view into the channel (<-chan). Once we
make this distinction between channel owners and nonchannel owners, the results
from the preceding table follow naturally, and we can begin to assign responsibilities
to goroutines that own channels and those that do not.
Let’s begin with channel owners. The goroutine that owns a channel should:
1. Instantiate the channel.
2. Perform writes, or pass ownership to another goroutine.
3. Close the channel.
4. Encapsulate the previous three things in this list and expose them via a reader
channel.

chanOwner := func() <-chan int {
 resultStream := make(chan int, 5)
 go func() {
 defer close(resultStream)
 for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
 resultStream <- i
 }
 }()
 return resultStream
}
resultStream := chanOwner()
for result := range resultStream {
 fmt.Printf("Received: %d\n", result)
}
fmt.Println("Done receiving!")

The consumer function only has access to a read channel, and therefore only needs to
know how it should handle blocking reads and channel closes.
-->

<!-- 
  Closing a channel is also one of the ways you can signal multiple goroutines simultaneously.
Since a closed channel can be read from an infinite number of times, it doesn’t matter
how many goroutines are waiting on it.

begin := make(chan interface{})
var wg sync.WaitGroup
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
 wg.Add(1)
 go func(i int) {
 defer wg.Done()
 <-begin
 fmt.Printf("%v has begun\n", i)
 }(i)
}
fmt.Println("Unblocking goroutines...")
close(begin)
wg.Wait()
