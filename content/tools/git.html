<h3>Concepts</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<!--
- Git is a distributed version control system that stores data as a series of snapshots of the project over time.
- Every time you save the state of your project (i.e. commit), Git takes a snapshot of all the project files at that moment. 
-->



<h4>Repositories</h4>

<!-- 
A bare repository does not have a working directory which prevents any development happening in the central repository. Instead, a bare repository is typically used for storage and is updated by pushing to it from another repository.

-->


<h4>File Classifications</h4>

<!--
- Files are classified into three groups:

1. Tracked: A file that is either already in the repository or that is staged in the index.
2. Ignored: A file that has been declared as ignored in the .gitignore file even though it is present in the working directory.
3. Untracked: A file that is not in either of the previous two categories.
-->


<h4>File States</h4>

<!-- 
A file can be in one of three states:

- Modified: File has been changed but has not been committed yet.
- Staged: Modified file has been marked to be included in the next commit.
- Committed: File has been stored in the local repository.

There are three main sections of a Git project:

- Working tree: A single checkout of one version of the project.
- Staging area (index): Stores changes that will be included in the next commit.
- Repository: Stores the metadata and object database for the project.

The basic workflow is as follows:

1. Modify files in the working tree.
2. Selectively add changes to the staging area.
3. Commit the staged changes by taking a snapshot of their current state and store that snapshot in the repository.


- A file can be in one of three main states:
  - Modified: The file has been changed but those changes have not yet been committed.
  - Staged: A modified file has been marked so that its current version will go into the next commit.
  - Committed: The changed have been stored in your local repository.
- These states correspond to the three main areas of a repository:
  - Working tree: A single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
  - Staging area: Stores information about what will go into your next commit.
  - Git directory: Where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
- The basic Git workflow involves modifying files in your working tree, selectively staging those changes for the next commit and committing those changes to store a snapshot of the files in the staging area.
-->

<h4>Snapshots</h4>

<!--
- A snapshot represents the state of your project at a given point in time.
-->



<h3>Index</h3>

<!-- 
We can stage multiple files before actually committing it to the project history.
Staging gives us the opportunity to group related changes into distinct snapshots.

We have staged a snapshot, but we still need to commit it to the project history.

1. Staging. Telling Git what files to include in the next commit.
2. Committing. Recording the staged snapshot with a descriptive message.

The distinction between the working directory, the staged snapshot, and committed snapshots is at the very core of Git version control. 

If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, itâ€™s considered committed. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
-->


<h4>Commits</h4>

<!--
- There are three areas of a repository: working tree, staging area and history (i.e. commit graph).
- Changes are made in the working tree and then added to the staging area. A commit takes a snapshot of the staged changes and adds that snapshot to the history.
- Focus is place on the changes to a file rather than the file itself. Adding files to the staging area causes git to take note of the current state of that file to be committed later.
- Only changes that have been added to the staging area will be committed. Further changes to a file will need to be added before they can be committed.
- A separate staging step allows you to edit multiple files and then separate those changes into separate commits by only staging the changes that are logically related.
- Each commit is identified by a SHA-1 hash and the first few hexadecimal characters of those hashes are typically used to refer to specific commits.

- Making a commit refers to recording the changes 
- The fundamental workflow consists of making changes, staging those changes and then committing those changes.
- A commit is uniquely identified by a SHA-1 checksum of the it contents. A commit is usually referred to by the first seven characters of this checksum.
- A new commit refers to its parent commit.
-->


<h4>HEAD</h4>

<!--
- The HEAD pointer determines your current working revision (and thereby the files that are placed in your working directory).
- HEAD is a special pointer that is used to keep track of which branch you are currently on.
- Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the HEAD pointer along when you create a new commit. You are automatically on the newest commit of the chosen branch.

- The HEAD is a pointer indicating the snapshot that is currently checked out.
- The HEAD is a pointer to the current branch reference which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch.
- This means that HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created.
- The HEAD is automatically moved forward to the new commit as commits are made.
-->


<h4>Detached HEAD</h4>

<!-- 
- A checkout determines which revision of your project you want to work on.
- Normally, you checkout a particular branch though you can also checkout a specific commit using its SHA-1 hash. 
- Checking out a specific commit is called a "detached HEAD" which has the consequence that the HEAD pointer will not be automatically moved when you create a new commit.
- As such, when you make changes and commit them, these changes do not belong to any branch.
- This means they can easily get lost once you check out a different revision or branch: not being recorded in the context of a branch, you lack the possibility to access that state easily.
- If you want to review an older revisions then it is probably preferable to simply create a temporary branch specifying the desired commit and then delete it once you are done.

https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/detached-head-when-checkout-commit/
-->


<h4>Tags</h4>

<!--
Tags are convenient references to official releases and other significant milestones in a software project. It lets developers easily browse and check out important revisions.

The -a flag tells Git to create an annotated tag, which lets us record our name, the date, and a descriptive message (specified via
the -m flag).


- Tags are used to indicate that a particular commit in the history of a repository is significant.
- A lightweight tag simply points to a particular commit while an annotated tag contains the tagger name, email and date as well as a tagging message.
-->


<h4>Branches</h4>

<!--
- A branch is a movable pointer to a commit.
- As you make commits, the current branch will move forward automatically to the last commit.
- A branch is linear history of commits that corresponds to an independent line of development.
- The currently checkout out branch corresponds to the contents of the working directory.
- The default branch is called "master".
-->




<h4>Merge</h4>

  <caption>Fast-Forward Merge</caption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/tools/git/3-way-merge.svg" height="100%" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px;">
  <caption>3-Way Merge</caption>
</figure>

<!--
- A "fast-forward" merge occurs when the branch being merged into the current branch is directly ahead of the current branch so the current branch pointer is simply moved forward.
- If the commit on the current branch is not a direct ancestor of the branch being merged into the current commit then a three-way merge is performed between the two latest branch commits and the most recent common ancestor of the two. Instead of moving the branch pointer forward, a new commit is made with the result of the three-way marge.

- Merging creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially include all the work from both and the set of all their parents.
- By merging master into your feature branch periodically, you can pick up any changes to master and keep your changes in greet compatible with changes in the mainline.

When the history of two branches diverges, a dedicated commit is required to combine the branches.

A 3-way merge occurs when you try to merge two branches whose history has diverged. It creates an extra merge commit to function as a link between the two branches. As a result, it has two parent commits.

When git branch creates a branch, it uses the current HEAD as the starting point for the new branch.

Fast-forward merges are not reflected in the project history. This is the tangible distinction between fast-forward merges and 3-way merges.
-->


<h4>Rebase</h4>


<figure>
  <img src="/img/tools/git/rebase.svg" height="100%" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px;">
  <caption>Rebase</caption>
</figure>

<!--
- A rebase is similar to a merge except that the commit tree for the current branch will be rewritten so that the merged branch is a part of the commit history. This leaves the chain of commits linear and much easier to read.
- Don't use rebase if the branch is public and shared or when the exact history of the commit branch is important. Typically, one could use rebase for short-lived, local branches and merge for branches in the public repository.

- Rebasing involves taking all the changes that were committed on one branch and replaying them on a different branch.
- This works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches, getting the diff introduced by each commit of the current branch, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto and finally applying each change in turn.

- It is common to rebase local changed before pushing to clean up your work but never rebase anything that has already been pushed.
-->


<h4>Merge Conflicts</h4>

<!-- 
- A conflict occurs if a merge occurs between branches that have made changes to the same content.
- The conflict must be manually resolved before anything else can be committed.
- During a conflict, the <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> markers are added to the affected lines so the conflict can be manually resolved.
- These markers should be deleted as part of resolving the conflict after which we can stage the changes made while resolving conflict and make a commit to complete the merge.

- If the same part of the same file has been changed in two branches that are being merged then a merge conflict will occur.
- In this case, conflict-resolution markers will be added to the files that have conflicts so they can be manually resolved.
- After the conflicts have been resolved, the conflicted files can be staged to mark them as resolved following which a commit can be made to finalize the merge commit.
-->

<h4>Merge vs Rebase</h4>

<!--
When you are ahead of master, both do the same thing.

If you're ahead and behind master, then a fast-forward merge isn't possible, since there are newer commits on master. But in that case, you can rebase, creating new commits based on the commits that are ahead of master.

When you're ahead of master:

            *E-*F-*G-*H-*I    BRANCH
           /
*A-*B-*C-*D                   MAIN

When you do a fast forward merge the main pointer is moved forward to the tip of the branch. When you rebase each commit of the branch is moved after the head of MAIN. The end result is the same:

*A-*B-*C-*D-*E-*F-*G-*H-*I MAIN | BRANCH

When you are ahead as well as behind of MAIN:

            *E-*F-*G-*H-*I    BRANCH
           /
*A-*B-*C-*D-*J-*K             MAIN

Then you can't fast-forward merge E..I into main, since J..K are in the way. So fast-forward isn't possible in this case.

But you can rebase E..I onto K:

*A-*B-*C-*D-*J-*K-*E'-*F'-*G'-*H'-*I'             MAIN | BRANCH

But what happens is that a new commit is made containing the changes of E and appended to main, then a new commit is made with the changes of F and appended to main... etc etc until all commits from the branch have been "moved"/"replayed" on the other branch. The result is again a single line of history with no branches and merges.

Because the commits had to be re-applied and conflicts potentially resolved, the actual commits will change, a new commit-id generated etc.

<h4>Stashing</h4>


<h4>Remotes</h4>

<!-- 
- A remote repository is another repository typically found a remote system (though it could also be local).
- A local copy of a remote repository is made by cloning the remote repository. The cloned repository identifies the remote repository from which it was cloned as the shortname origin.
- Branches in the remote repository are not treated as local branches.
-->



<h4>Remote-Tracking Branches</h4>

<!-- 
- Remote-tracking branches are local references to the state of remote branches that are moved automatically when you do any network connection.
- Remote-tracking branch names take the form <remote>/<branch>.
- Performing a fetch will move the remote-tracking branch to its up-to-date position.
- If you make a commit to a local branch and, in the meantime, someone else pushes commits to the corresponding remote branch then the histories will move forward differently and performing a fetch will result in the local branch and the remote-tracking branch diverging.
-->



<h4>Synchronization</h4>

<!--
- The fetch command will fetch new commits from the remote repository, but it will not merge these commits into the local branches whereas pull combines these steps.
- Local commits can then be pushed to the remote repository.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4693588/what-is-a-tracking-branch -->


<h4>Ignoring Files</h4>

<!--
- A special .gitignore file allows us to ignore certain files.
- Each file or directory specified in the .gitignore will be invisible to Git.
- Although the .gitignore file has special meaning to Git, it is managed just like any other normal file within your repository.
