<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Data is organized into tables that represent a collection of particular entities.
  </li>
  <li>
    The columns of a table represent the attributes of the entity that table represents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each row in the table represents an individual entity and the values in the row correspond to the attributes of that entity.
  </li>
  <li>
    A primary key consists of one or more columns that can be used to uniquely identify each row in a table.
  </li>
  <li>
    A primary key that is composed of two or more columns is called a compound key.
  </li>
  <li>
    A foreign key consists of one or more columns that can be used to identify a row in another table.
  </li>
  <li>
    Normalization is the process of refining a database design to ensure that each independent piece of information (apart from foreign keys) is in only one place.
  </li>
  <li>
    Null is used to indicate the absence of a value and is used when a value is not applicable, unknown or undefined. 
  </li>

<h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>
  SQLite guarantees all the transactions are ACID compliant:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Atomic: A transaction cannot be broken into smaller units and so is either applied in its entirety or not at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consistent: A transaction can only change the database from one valid state to another.
  </li>
  <li>
    Isolation: A pending transaction performed by a session must only be visible to the current session.
  </li>
  <li>
    Durable: If a transaction is successfully committed then the changes must be permanent in the database regardless of scenarios like crashes or power failures.
  </li>
</ul>

{{% code sql %}}-- start transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- create savepoint
SAVEPOINT save;

-- rollback to savepoint
ROLLBACK TO save;

-- remove savepoint
RELEASE save;

-- rollback transaction
ROLLBACK;

-- commit transaction
COMMIT;{{% /code %}}

<p>
  Releasing a save-point will not commit any modifications to disk, nor will it make those changes available to other database connections accessing the same database. Changes bounded by a released save-point may still be lost if the transaction is rolled back to a prior save-point or if the whole transaction is rolled back.
</p>

<!--

<h3>Indexes</h3>

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);

<!-- 
  In the same way that a person uses an index to find words within a publication, a
database server uses indexes to locate rows in a table. Indexes are special tables that,
unlike normal data tables, are kept in a specific order. Instead of containing all of the
data about an entity, however, an index contains only the column (or columns) used
to locate rows in the data table, along with information describing where the rows are
physically located. Therefore, the role of indexes is to facilitate the retrieval of a subset
of a table’s rows and columns without the need to inspect every row in the table.

  How do I create an AUTOINCREMENT field?

Short answer: A column declared INTEGER PRIMARY KEY will autoincrement.

Longer answer: If you declare a column of a table to be INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, then whenever you insert a NULL into that column of the table, the NULL is automatically converted into an integer which is one greater than the largest value of that column over all other rows in the table, or 1 if the table is empty. Or, if the largest existing integer key 9223372036854775807 is in use then an unused key value is chosen at random. For example, suppose you have a table like this:

CREATE TABLE t1(
  a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  b INTEGER
);
With this table, the statement

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(NULL,123);
is logically equivalent to saying:

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES((SELECT max(a) FROM t1)+1,123);
There is a function named sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() which will return the integer key for the most recent insert operation.

Note that the integer key is one greater than the largest key that was in the table just prior to the insert. The new key will be unique over all keys currently in the table, but it might overlap with keys that have been previously deleted from the table. To create keys that are unique over the lifetime of the table, add the AUTOINCREMENT keyword to the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY declaration. Then the key chosen will be one more than the largest key that has ever existed in that table. If the largest possible key has previously existed in that table, then the INSERT will fail with an SQLITE_FULL error code.



 Does SQLite support foreign keys?

As of version 3.6.19 (2009-10-14), SQLite supports foreign key constraints. But enforcement of foreign key constraints is turned off by default (for backwards compatibility). To enable foreign key constraint enforcement, run PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON or compile with -DSQLITE_DEFAULT_FOREIGN_KEYS=1.

# 3. SELECT

1. Retrieve the actor ID, first name, and last name for all actors. Sort by last name and then by first name.

SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

2. Retrieve the actor ID, first name, and last name for all actors whose last name equals 'WILLIAMS' or 'DAVIS'.

SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS','DAVIS');

3. Returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on 2005-07-05. Include a single row for each distinct customer ID.

SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05';

4. Return the email addresses and return dates of all the customers who rented a film on 2005-06-14 ordered by the return time in descending order of return date.

SELECT c.email, r.return_date
FROM customer AS c
  INNER JOIN rental AS r
  ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14'
ORDER BY return_date DESC;


# 4. WHERE

3. Construct a query that retrieves all rows from the payment table where the amount is either 1.98, 7.98, or 9.98.

SELECT * FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.98, 7.98, 9.98);

4. Construct a query that finds all customers whose last name contains an A in the second position and a W anywhere after the A.

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE last_name LIKE '_A%W%';


# 5. INNER JOIN

2. Write a query that returns the title of every film in which an actor with the first name JOHN appeared.

SELECT f.title
FROM film AS f
  INNER JOIN film_actor AS fa
    ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
  INNER JOIN actor AS a
    ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
WHERE a.first_name = 'JOHN';
