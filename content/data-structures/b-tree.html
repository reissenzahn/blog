<p>
  A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that allows for search, insertion and deletion in logarithmic tree. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree by allowing nodes to store more than one key and to have more than two children. The B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data and is commonly used in databases and file systems.
</p>


<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
  A B-tree of order m is a tree that satisfies the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Every node has at most m children.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every non-leaf node (except the root) has at least ⌈m/2⌉ children.
  </li>
  <li>
    The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node.
  </li>
  <li>
    A non-leaf node with k children contains k - 1 keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  All nodes other than the root and leaf nodes are called internal nodes. The keys of internal nodes act as separator which divide its subtrees. For instance, if an internal node has 3 child nodes then it must have 2 keys. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than the first key, all values in the middle subtree will be between the keys and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than the second key.

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>
  To search for a particular target key, we start at the root and typically apply binary search to find the child whose range includes the target key. The search continues recursively in this manner until the target values is found or a leaf node is reached.
</p>



<h3>Insertion</h3>

<p>
  To insert a key, we start at the root and search the tree to find the leaf node where the new key should be addded. If the node contains fewer keys than the maximum allowed then the key can simply be inserted so as to keep the keys ordered. Otherwise, if the node is full, then we need to evenly split the node into two nodes as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    A single median key is chosen from the current keys and the new keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keys less than the median are put in the new left node and keys greater than the median are put in the new right node.
  </li>
  <li>
    The median is inserted in the parent of the node. Thi may cause the parent node to e split and so on. If the node has no parent then a new root is created.
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- 
  A B-tree is kept balanced after insertion by splitting a would-be overfilled node, of {\displaystyle 2d+1}2d+1 keys, into two {\displaystyle d}d-key siblings and inserting the mid-value key into the parent. Depth only increases when the root is split, maintaining balance. Similarly, a B-tree is kept balanced after deletion by merging or redistributing keys among siblings to maintain the {\displaystyle d}d-key minimum for non-root nodes. A merger reduces the number of keys in the parent potentially forcing it to merge or redistribute keys with its siblings, and so on. The only change in depth occurs when the root has two children, of {\displaystyle d}d and (transitionally) {\displaystyle d-1}d-1 keys, in which case the two siblings and parent are merged, reducing the depth by one.
-->


<h3>Deletion</h3>

<p>
  To delete a key, we remove it and then restructure the tree. There are three cases to consider:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    If the key is in a leaf node then we search for it and remove it. If the node is left with fewer keys than the minimum then we rebalance.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the key is in an internal node 
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Rebalancing after Deletion</h3>

<p>
  Rebalancing starts from a leaf and proceeds towards the root until the tree is balanced by means of rotations or merging:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the right sibling of the deficient node exists and has more than the minimum number of keys then we rotate left:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the separator from the parent to the end of the deficient node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace the separator in the parent with the first key of the right sibling.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the left sibling of deficient node exists and has more than the minimum number of keys the we rotate right:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the separate from the parent to the start of the deficient node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace the separator in the parent with the last key of the left sibling.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If no sibling can spare a key, then the deficient node must be merged with a sibling:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Copy the separator to the end of the left node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move all elements from the right node to the left node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the separator from the parent along with its empty child.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the parent is the root and now has no keys then free it and make the merged node the new root. Otherwise, if the parent has fewer than the required number of elements then rebalance the parent.
      </li>
    </ol>    
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- 
  Notice that every internal node contains a maximum of U children and a minimum of L children. The number of keys is always 1 less than the number of children (i.e. between L - 1 and U - 1). Also, U must be either 2L or 2L - 1 so each internal node is at least half full. This implies that two half-full nodes can be joined to make a legal node and one full node can be split into two legal nodes (provide there is room to push one key up into the parent). These properties make it possible to delete and insert new values into a B-tree while adjusting the tree to preserve the required properties.

  B-trees have substantial advantages over alternative implementations when the time to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in secondary storage such as disk drives. By maximizing the number of keys within each internal node, the height of the tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full disk block or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2–3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.
