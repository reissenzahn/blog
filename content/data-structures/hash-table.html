<p>
  A hash table is an associative data structure that stores entries consisting of key-value pairs. An insert operation adds key-value pairs to the hash table while a remove operation allows us to remove a key-value pair. We can also lookup the value associated with a given key in constant time. This is achieved by using a hash function to map the key to an index into an underlying array corresponding to where the value is stored.
</p>


<h3>Hash Functions</h3>

<p>
  A hash function H : X → [0, M) maps an element x ∈ X to a positive integer H(x) ∈ [0, M). Typically, the number of elements in X is much greater than M and so we will have x1, x2 ∈ X such that H(x1) = H(x2) in which case a hash collision is said to occur. These functions must be deterministic so the hash of a given key must always be the same. A good hash function fast to compute and minimizes collisions by dispersing hashes randomly and uniformly.
</p>


<h3>Insertion and Lookup</h3>

<p>
  A hash table stores values in an underlying array. When a key-value pair is inserted, a hash function is used to compute an index from the key and the value is stored at that index in an array. During lookup, the key is hashed using the hash function and the resulting index indicates where the value can be found in the array.

<p>
  The load factor α = k/n where n is the capacity of the underlying array and k is the number of currently occupied entries. The performance of a hash table worsens as α increases and so it is essential to resize the hash table when the load factor exceeds a certain value. This involves creating a new array with a larger capacity and rehashing all items inside the old array to disperse them throughout the new array. Typical load factor thresholds are 0.6 and 0.75.
</p>


<h3>Hash Collisions</h3>

<p>
  A hash collision occurs when the hash function returns the same values for two different keys. When this occurs, a hash collision resolution technique must be used. The most popular of these techniques are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Separate chaining: Values whose keys are hashed to a particular array index are stored in a data structure (such as a linked list) which stores key-value pairs. Lookups require scanning the linked list for the desired pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open addressing: Hash collisions are dealt with by finding another vacant position in the array. More specifically, we try another position by offsetting the current position according to a probing sequence P(x) modulo the table size until an unoccupied slot is found.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Probing Sequences</h3>

<p>
  Some common probing sequences for open addressing include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Linear probing: P(x) = ax + b
  </li>
  <li>
    Quadratic probing: P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
  </li>
  <li>
    Double hashing: P(k, x) = x * H(k)  (where H is a secondary hash function)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Notice that most randomly selected probing sequence modulo the table size will produce a cycle shorter than the table size. This can result in an infinite loop if all the entries on the cycle are occupied. To avoid this, we can choose to only use probing functions which produce cycles of the length of the hash table.
