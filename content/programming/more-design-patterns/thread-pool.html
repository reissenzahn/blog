Increase performance and avoid latency in execution by maintaining a pool of threads waiting for tasks.


Description

- A thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program.
- By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks.
- The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available to the program.


The size of a thread pool is the number of threads kept in reserve for executing tasks. It is usually a tunable parameter of the application, adjusted to optimize program performance. Deciding the optimal thread pool size is crucial to optimize performance.

One benefit of a thread pool over creating a new thread for each task is that thread creation and destruction overhead is restricted to the initial creation of the pool, which may result in better performance and better system stability.

An excessive number of threads in reserve, however, wastes memory, and context-switching between the runnable threads invokes performance penalties.
