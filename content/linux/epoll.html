<ul>
  <li>
    The epoll API allows a process to monitor multiple file descriptors simultaneously to see whether an I/O system call could be performed without blocking.
  </li>
  <li>
    The central data structure of epoll is an <i>epoll instance</i> which is referred to via an open file descriptor.
  </li>
  <li>
    The file descriptor is used as a handle for the <i>interest list</i> (the list of file descriptors the process has declared an interest in monitoring) and the <i>ready list</i> (the list of file descriptors that are ready for I/O).
  </li>
  <li>
    When a file descriptor is added to an epoll instance, we can choose between two models of readiness notification:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Level-triggered</i>: A file descriptor is considered to be ready if it is possible to perform an I/O system call without blocking. This is the default behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Edge-triggered</i>: Notification is provided if there is I/O activity (e.g. new input) on a file descriptor since it was last monitored.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The limit of the total number of file descriptors that each user can register in all epoll interest lists can be viewed and modified via the <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code> file.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- 
With edge-triggered notification, a call to epoll_wait() tells us if there has been I/O activity on a file descriptor since the previous call to epoll_wait() (or since the descriptor was opened, if there was no previous call).

With the level-triggered model it is not necessary to perform as much I/O as possible on the file descriptor each time we are notified that a file descriptor is ready. By contrast, programs that employ edge-triggered notification typically perform as much I/O as possible after notification of an I/O event. Monitored file descriptors are also normally placed in non-blocking mode.

<h3>System Calls</h3>

<h4>epoll_create()</h4>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/epoll.h>

int epoll_create(int size);{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>epoll_create()</code> system call creates a new epoll instance whose interest list is initially empty and returns a file descriptor used to refer to the new epoll instance.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>size</code> argument is ignored but must be greater than zero.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the epoll instance is no longer required, its file descriptor should be closed with <code>close()</code>. When all file descriptors referring to an epoll instance are closed, the instance is destroyed.
  </li>
  <li>
    A call to <code>epoll_create()</code> returns a file descriptor referring to the instance on success or <code>-1</code> on error.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>epoll_ctl()</h4>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/epoll.h>

int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *ev);

struct epoll_event {
  uint32_t events;    // epoll events (bit mask)
  epoll_data_t data;  // user data
 };
 
typedef union epoll_data {
  void *ptr;     // pointer to user-defined data
  int fd;        // file descriptor
  uint32_t u32;  // 32-bit integer
  uint64_t u64;  // 64-bit integer
} epoll_data_t;{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>epoll_ctl()</code> system call modifies the interest list of the epoll instance referred to by <code>epfd</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>fd</code> argument can be a file descriptor for a pipe, FIFO, socket, POSIX message queue, inotify instance, terminal, device or even another epoll descriptor (i.e. we can build a kind of hierarchy of monitored descriptors). However, it must not be a file descriptor for a regular file or a directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>op</code> argument specifies the operation to be performed:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</code>: Add the file descriptor <code>fd</code> to the interest list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</code>: Modify the events setting for the file descriptor <code>fd</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</code>: Remove the file descriptor <code>fd</code> from the interest list.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>ev</code> argument specifies settings for the file descriptor <code>fd</code>. The <code>ev</code> argument is specified as <code>NULL</code> for <code>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</code>.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>events</code> subfield is a bit mask specifying the set of events that we are interested in monitoring for <code>fd</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>data</code> subfield is a union, one of whose members can be used to specify information that is passed back to the calling process <code>via epoll_wait()</code> if <code>fd</code> later becomes ready.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>epoll_wait()</h4>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/epoll.h>

int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *evlist, int maxevents, int timeout);{{% /code %}}

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>epoll_wait()</code> system call returns information about ready file descriptors from the epoll instance referred to by <code>epfd</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The information about ready file descriptors is returned in the array of <code>epoll_event</code> structures pointed to by <code>evlist</code>. The <code>evlist</code> array is allocated by the caller and the number of elements it contains is specified in <code>maxevents</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each item in the array <code>evlist</code> returns information about a single ready file descriptor. The <code>events</code> subfield returns a mask of the events that have occurred on this descriptor. The <code>data</code> subfield returns whatever value was specified in <code>ev.data</code> in the call to <code>epoll_ctl()</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note that the <code>data</code> field provides the only mechanism for finding out the number of the file descriptor associated with this event. Thus, we should either set <code>ev.data.fd</code> to the file descriptor number or set <code>ev.data.ptr</code> to point to a structure that contains the file descriptor number in the call to <code>epoll_ctl()</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The timeout argument determines the blocking behavior of <code>epoll_wait()</code> as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>timeout=-1</code>: Block until an event occurs for one of the file descriptors in the interest list for <code>epfd</code> or until a signal is caught.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>timeout=0</code>: Perform a non-blocking check to see which events are currently available on the file descriptors in the interest list for <code>epfd</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>timeout=n</code>: Block for up to <code>timeout</code> milliseconds until an event occurs on one of the file descriptors in the interest list for <code>epfd</code> or until a signal is caught.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A call to <code>epoll_wait()</code> returns the number of items that have been placed in the array <code>evlist</code> or <code>0</code> if no file descriptors were ready within the interval specified by timeout. On error, it returns <code>-1</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A call to <code>epoll_wait()</code> returns the number of items that have been placed in the array <code>evlist</code>, <code>0</code> if no file descriptors were ready within the interval specified by timeout or <code>-1</code> on error.
  </li>
</ul>



<h3>Epoll Events</h3>


<ul>
  <li>
    The bit values that can be specified in <code>ev.events</code> when we call <code>epoll_ctl()</code> are as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLIN</code>: Data other than high-priority data can be read.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLPRI</code>: High-priority data can be read.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLRDHUP</code>: Shutdown on peer socket.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLOUT</code>: Normal data can be written.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLET</code>: Employ edge-triggered event notification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLONESHOT</code>: Disable monitoring after event notification.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The bit and that are placed in the <code>evlist[].events</code> fields returned by <code>epoll_wait()</code> include <code>EPOLLIN</code>, <code>EPOLLPRI</code>, <code>EPOLLRDHUP</code> and <code>EPOLLOUT</code> as above as well as:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLERR</code>: Indicates an error has occurred.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>EPOLLHUP</code>: Indicates a hangup has occurred.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<!-- 
  If we want to be notified only once about a particular file descriptor then we can specify the <code>EPOLLONESHOT</code> flag in the <code>ev.events</code> value passed in epoll_ctl(). If this flag is specified, then, after the next epoll_wait() call that informs us that the corresponding file descriptor is ready, the file descriptor is marked inactive in the interest list, and we will not be informed about its state by future epoll_wait() calls. If desired, we can subsequently reenable monitoring of this file descriptor using the epoll_ctl() <code>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</code> operation.
-->


<h3>Enabling Edge-Triggered Notification</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    To employ edge-triggered notification, we specify the <code>EPOLLET</code> flag in ev.events when calling epoll_ctl().
  </li>
  <li>
    The general framework for using edge-triggered epoll notification is involves making all file descriptors that are to be monitored non-blocking before building the epoll interest list using epoll_ctl().
  </li>
  <li>
    We then handle I/O events in a loop by first retrieving a list of ready descriptors using epoll_wait() and then, for each file descriptor that is ready, process I/O until the relevant system call (e.g., read(), write(), recv(), send(), or accept()) returns with the error EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.
  </li>
</ul>
