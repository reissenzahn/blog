<p>
  Some applications need to be able to monitor files or directories in order to determine whether events have occurred for the monitored objects. The inotify mechanism allows an application to monitor file events.
</p>

<!-- 
  The Linux-specific inotify mechanism allows an application to obtain notifications
when events (files are opened, closed, created, deleted, modified, renamed, and so
on) occur for a set of monitored files and directories. 
 -->


<h3>Watch List and Event Notifications</h3>

<p>
  Using the inotify API proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The process calls inotify_init() to create an inotify instance. This returns a file descriptor that is used to refer to the inotify instance in later operations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The process informs the kernel about which files are of interest using inotify_add_watch() to add items to the watch list of the inotify instance. Each watch item consists of a pathname and an associated bit mask which specifies the set of events to be monitored. The inotify_add_watch() calls return watch descriptors which are used to refer to the watches in later operations. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, the inotify_rm_watch() system call removes a watch that was previously addded to an inotify instance.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to obtain event notifications, the application performs read() operations on the inotify file descriptor. Each successful read() returns one or more inotify_event structures, each containing information about an event that occurred on one of the pathnames being watched via this inotify instance.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the application has finished monitoring, it closes the inotify file descriptor. This automatically removes all watch items associated with the inotify instance.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The inotify mechanism can be used to monitor files or directories. When monitoring a directory, the application will be informed about events for the directory itself and for files inside the directory. However, the inotify monitoring mechanism is not recursive. If an application wants to monitor events within an entire directory subtree, it must issue inotify_add_watch() calls for each directory in the tree.
</p>

<!-- 
  An inotify file descriptor can be monitored using select(), poll(), epoll, and, since
Linux 2.6.25, signal-driven I/O. If events are available to be read, then these interfaces indicate the inotify file descriptor as being readable.
 -->


<h3>Creating an inotify Instance</h3>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/inotify.h>

int inotify_init(void);{{% /code %}}

<p>
  The inotify_init() system call creates a new inotify instance. As its function result, inotify_init() returns a file descriptor. This file descriptor is the handle that is used to refer to the inotify instance in subsequent operations. On error, -1 is returned.
</p>


<h3>Adding Watch Items</h3>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/inotify.h>

int inotify_add_watch(int fd, const char *pathname, uint32_t mask);{{% /code %}}

<p>
  The inotify_add_watch() system call either adds a new watch item to or modifies an existing watch item in the watch list for the inotify instance referred to by the file descriptor fd. The pathname argument identifies the file for which a watch item is to be created or modified. The caller must have read permission for this file. The mask argument is a bit mask that specifies the events to be monitored for pathname. It returns watch descriptor on success, or –1 on error.
</p>

<p>
  If pathname has not previously been added to the watch list for fd, then inotify_add_watch() creates a new watch item in the list and returns a new, nonnegative watch descriptor, which is used to refer to the watch item in later operations. This watch descriptor is unique for this inotify instance. If pathname has previously been added to the watch list for fd, then inotify_add_watch() modifies the mask of the existing watch item for pathname and returns the watch descriptor for that item. 
</p>


<h3>Removing Watch Items</h3>

{{% code c %}}#include <sys/inotify.h>

int inotify_rm_watch(int fd, uint32_t wd);{{% /code %}}

<p>
  The inotify_rm_watch() system call removes the watch item specified by wd from the inotify instance referred to by the file descriptor fd. The wd argument is a watch descriptor returned by a previous call to inotify_add_watch(). Removing a watch causes an IN_IGNORED event to be generated for this watch descriptor. It returns 0 on success or -1 on error.
</p>


<h3>Monitoring for Events</h3>

<p>
  When we create or modify a watch using inotify_add_watch(), the mask bit-mask argument identifies the events to be monitored for the given pathname. Some of the event bits are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    IN_OPEN: File was opened.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_ACCESS: File was accessed (i.e. read()).
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_ATTRIB: File metadata changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_CLOSE_WRITE: File opened for writing was closed.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE: File opened read-only was closed.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_CREATE: File/directory created inside watched directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_DELETE: File/directory deleted from within watched directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_DELETE_SELF: Watched file/directory was itself deleted.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_MODIFY: File was modified.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_MOVE_SELF: Watched file/directory was itself moved.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_MOVED_FROM: File moved out of watched directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_MOVED_TO: File moved into watched directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    IN_ALL_EVENTS: Shorthand for all of the above input events.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Handling Events</h3>

<p>
  Having registered items in the watch list, an application can determine which events have occurred by using read() to read events from the inotify file descriptor. If no events have occurred so far, then read() blocks until an event occurs (unless the O_NONBLOCK status flag has been set for the file descriptor, in which case the read() fails immediately with the error EAGAIN if no events are available). After events have occurred, each read() returns a buffer containing one or more inotify_event structures.
</p>

{{% code c %}}struct inotify_event {
  int wd;           // watch descriptor on which event occurred
  uint32_t mask;    // bits describing event that occurred
  uint32_t cookie;  // cookie for related events (for rename())
  uint32_t len;     // size of name
  char name[];      // optional null-terminated filename
};{{% /code %}}

<p>
  The wd field tells us the watch descriptor for which this event occurred. This field contains one of the values returned by a previous call to inotify_add_watch(). The mask field returns a bit mask that describes the event. 
</p>

<!-- 
  The cookie field is used to tie related events together. Currently, this field is used
only when a file is renamed. When this happens, an IN_MOVED_FROM event is generated
for the directory from which the file is renamed, and then an IN_MOVED_TO is generated for the directory to which the file is renamed. (If a file is given a new name
within the same directory, then both events occur for the same directory.) These
two events will have the same unique value in their cookie field, thus allowing the
application to associate them.
When an event occurs for a file within a monitored directory, the name field is
used to return a null-terminated string that identifies the file. If the event occurs
for the monitored object itself, then the name field is unused, and the len field will
contain 0.
The len field indicates how many bytes are actually allocated for the name field.
 -->

<!-- 
  If the buffer passed to read() is too small to hold the next inotify_event structure,
then read() fails with the error EINVAL to warn the application of this fact.

  The
application could respond by performing another read() with a larger buffer. However, the problem can be avoided altogether by ensuring that the buffer is always
large enough to hold at least one event: the buffer given to read() should be at least
(sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1) bytes, where NAME_MAX is the maximum
length of a filename, plus one for the terminating null byte.
Using a larger buffer size than the minimum allows an application to efficiently
retrieve multiple events with a single read(). A read() from an inotify file descriptor
returns the minimum of the number of events that are available and the number of
events that will fit in the supplied buffer.
-->

<!-- 
  The events read from an inotify file descriptor form an ordered queue. Thus, for
example, it is guaranteed that when a file is renamed, the IN_MOVED_FROM event will be
read before the IN_MOVED_TO event.

When appending a new event to the end of the event queue, the kernel will
coalesce that event with the event at the tail of the queue (so that the new event is
not in fact queued), if the two events have the same values for wd, mask, cookie, and
name. This is done because many applications don’t need to know about repeated
instances of the same event, and dropping the excess events reduces the amount of
(kernel) memory required for the event queue. However, this means we can’t use
inotify to reliably determine how many times or how often a recurrent event occurs.
