MISC

Atomicity is a concept that weâ€™ll encounter repeatedly when discussing the operation of system calls. All system calls are executed atomically. By this, we mean that the kernel guarantees that all of the steps in a system call are completed as a single operation, without being interrupted by another process or thread.

Atomicity is essential to the successful completion of some operations. In particular, it allows us to avoid race conditions (sometimes known as race hazards). A race condition is a situation where the result produced by two processes (or threads) operating on shared resources depends in an unexpected way on the relative order in which the processes gain access to the CPU(s).



NOW: 49: Memory Mappings

The offset argument specifies the starting byte of the region to be mapped from the
file, and must be a multiple of the system page size. Specifying offset as 0 causes the file
to be mapped from the beginning.

Attempts to access bytes beyond the end of the mapping result in the generation of a SIGSEGV signal (assuming that there is no other mapping at that location). The default action for this signal is to terminate the process with a core dump.


One point that we have not so far explained in detail is the interaction between the
memory protection specified in the mmap() prot argument and the mode in which the
mapped file is opened. As a general principle, we can say that the PROT_READ and
PROT_EXEC protections require that the mapped file is opened O_RDONLY or O_RDWR, and that
the PROT_WRITE protection requires that the mapped file is opened O_WRONLY or O_RDWR.
