<p>
  A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

<!-- 
A node is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure (which could be a tree of its own). Each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn growing downwards). A node that has a child is called the child's parent node (or superior). A node has at most one parent, but possibly many ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same parent are sibling nodes.

An internal node (also known as an inner node, inode for short, or branch node) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an external node (also known as an outer node, leaf node, or terminal node) is any node that does not have child nodes.

The topmost node in a tree is called the root node. Depending on definition, a tree may be required to have a root node (in which case all trees are non-empty), or may be allowed to be empty, in which case it does not necessarily have a root node. Being the topmost node, the root node will not have a parent. It is the node at which algorithms on the tree begin, since as a data structure, one can only pass from parents to children. Note that some algorithms (such as post-order depth-first search) begin at the root, but first visit leaf nodes (access the value of leaf nodes), only visit the root last (i.e., they first access the children of the root, but only access the value of the root last). All other nodes can be reached from it by following edges or links. (In the formal definition, each such path is also unique.) In diagrams, the root node is conventionally drawn at the top. In some trees, such as heaps, the root node has special properties. Every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the subtree rooted at that node.

The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL Trees in particular. The root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, and a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has height −1.

A subtree of a tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.[a][1] Nodes thus correspond to subtrees (each node corresponds to the subtree of itself and all its descendants) – the subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree, and each node is the root node of the subtree it determines; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree (by analogy to a proper subset).

Other terms used with trees:

Neighbor
Parent or child.
Ancestor
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
Descendant
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child. Also known as subchild.
Branch node
Internal node
A node with at least one child.
Degree
For a given node, its number of children. A leaf is necessarily degree zero. The degree of a tree is the degree of its root.
Degree of tree
The degree of the root.
Distance
The number of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.
Level
1 + the number of edges between a node and the root, i.e. (depth + 1)[dubious – discuss]
Width
The number of nodes in a level.
Breadth
The number of leaves.
Forest
A set of n ≥ 0 disjoint trees.
Ordered tree
A rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex.
Size of a tree
Number of nodes in the tree.
