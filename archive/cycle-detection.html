<p>
  A cycle in a graph is a non-empty sequence of edges in which only the first ad last vertices are equal. The existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined through applications of depth-first search. Many topological sorting algorithms also detect cycles.

<h3>Directed Graphs</h3>

<p>
  We start by declaring the sets white, gray and black. These sets are defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    White: vertices that have not been visited at all (initially contains all vertices in the graph).
  </li>
  <li>
    Gray: vertices currently being visited.
  </li>
  <li>
    Black: vertices that have been "totally" visited (visited and have had all their children visited).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We proceed by iterating over each of the vertices in the white set in arbitrary order. For each vertex, we begin a depth-first search starting at the vertex. The depth-first search proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Move the start vertex from the white set to the graph set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider each of the adjacent vertices
  </li>
</ol>
