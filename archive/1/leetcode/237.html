<h3 id="question">Question</h3>

<p>
  Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
</p>

<p>
  It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
</p>


<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

<b>Output:</b>
[4,1,9]

<b>Explanation:</b>
You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

<b>Output:</b>
[4,5,9]

<b>Explanation:</b>
You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.</pre>


<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Copy the value of the next node into the given node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Delete the next node.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="java">public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {

  // copy value of subsequent node into current node
  node.val = node.next.val;

  // delete subsequent node
  node.next = node.next.next;
}</code></pre>
