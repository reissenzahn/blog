<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined.
</p>



<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

<p>
  Given a graph and a start vertex \(s\), Dijkstra's algorithm proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize an array of distances from the start vertex to all other vertices. Set the initial distances to infinity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initialize an array of previous vertex indexes for all vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initialize a min-priority queue that contains (vertex index, distance) pairs prioritized based on the minimum distance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set the distance to \(s\) to zero and insert (s, 0) into the priority queue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dequeue a pair from the priority queue and mark the vertex index as visited.
  </li>
  <li>
    Iterate over all edges starting from the dequeued vertex such as to consider each of its neighbors. 
  </li>
  <li>
    If the neighbor is unvisited, then calculate the distance from the current vertex to the neighbor using the distance to the current vertex in the distance array.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the calculated distance is less than the current distance in the distance array then update the distance, set the previous vertex to the current vertex and enqueue the a (neighbor index, distance to neighbor) pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps X-X until the priority queue is empty or once we've visited vertices adjacent to the end vertex.
  </li>
</ol>

and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.

4. Iterate over all edges outwards from the current node and relax each edge appending a new (node index, distance) pair to the priority queue for every relaxation.

A neat optimization we can do which ignores stale (index, dist) pairs in our PQ is to skip nodes where we already found a better path routing through other nodes before we got to processing this node.

If you want to not only find the optimal distance to a particular node but also what sequence of nodes were taken to get there you need to track some additional information: the index of the previous node we took to get to the current node.

If we're only interesting in the shortest distance to a specific node then we can stop early once we have visited the destination node. The algorithm processes each next most promising node in order. So if the destination node has been visited, its shortest distance will not change as more future nodes are visited.

3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.
4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new "current node", and go back to step 3.

When planning a route, it is actually not necessary to wait until the destination node is "visited" as above: the algorithm can stop once the destination node has the smallest tentative distance among all "unvisited" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next "current").

<!--
Let distance of start vertex from start vertex = 0
Let distance of all other vertices from start = inf

1. Visit the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the start vertex.
2. For the current vertex, examine its unvisited neighbors.
3. For the current vertex, calculate the distance of each neighbor from the start vertex.
4. If the calculated distance of a vertex is less than the known distance, update the shortest distance.
5. Update the previous vertex for each of the updated distances.
6. Add the current vertex to the list of visited vertices.
7. Repeat until all vertices have been visited.

<h3 class="complexity">Complexity</h3>

<p>
  Dijkstra's algorithm uses a data structure for storing and querying partial solutions sorted by distance from the start. When using a min-priority queue the running time is \(O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)\). However, a Fibonacci heap min-priority queue can be used to optimize the running time to \(O(|E|+|V|\log |V|)\).

1. Maintain a `dist` array where the distance to every node is positive infinity.

Mark the distance to the start node `s` to be 0.

2. Maintain a priority queue of key-value pairs of (node index, distance) pairs which tell you which node to visit next based on sorted min value.

3. Insert (s, 0) into the priority queue and loop while the priority queue is not empty pulling out the next most promising (node index, distance) pair.

4. Iterate over all edges outwards from the current node and relax each edge appending a new (node index, distance) pair to the priority queue for every relaxation.
