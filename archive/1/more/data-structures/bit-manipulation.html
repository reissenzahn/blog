<h3 id="">Bits and Bytes</h3>

<!--
  The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.[1] The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1"or"0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/âˆ’, or on/off are common.

  A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a one- or more-dimensional bit array. A group of eight binary digits is called one byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined. Frequently, half-, full-, double- and quad-words consist of a number of bytes which is a low power of two.

<h3 id="">Bitwise Operators</h3>

<!-- 
  A bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.

  On simple low-cost processors, typically, bitwise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition.[clarification needed] While modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices, bitwise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.[1]

  In the explanations below, any indication of a bit's position is counted from the right (least significant) side, advancing left. For example, the binary value 0001 (decimal 1) has zeroes at every position but the first (i.e. the rightmost) one.
