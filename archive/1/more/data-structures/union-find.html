<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  A union-find is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same set.

<h3 id="">Representation</h3>

<!-- 
  Construct a bijection between your objects and the integers in the range [0, n).

  Randomly assign a mapping between the objects and the integers.

  Store Union Find information in an array. Each index has an associated object (letter in this example) we can lookup through our mapping.

  id[i] points to the parent of i; if id[i] = i then i is a root node
