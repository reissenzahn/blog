<h3>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</h3>

<p>
  Based on their experience at Sun Microsystems, L Peter Deutsch and others compiled the following list of false assumptions regarding distributed systems:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The network is reliable;
  </li>
  <li>
    Latency is zero;
  </li>
  <li>
    Bandwidth is infinite;
  </li>
  <li>
    The network is secure;
  </li>
  <li>
    Topology doesn't change;
  </li>
  <li>
    There is one administrator;
  </li>
  <li>
    Transport cost is zero;
  </li>
  <li>
    The network is homogenous;
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Internet Addresses</h3>

<!-- 
  The Internet uses an address scheme for devices such as computers so that they can be located.

  An IPv4 address consists of a 32 bit integer which is usually written as four bytes in decimal separated with periods as in 127.0.0.1 or 66.102.11.104.

  IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses which are usually written as groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons as in 2002:c0e8:82e7:0:0:0:c0e8:82e7.

  We can omit zeros and repeated digits. For example, the localhost address 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 can be shortened to ::1.

<h3>Ports</h3>

<!-- 
  The IP address will locate the host but that machine might have a number of running services. To distinguish between them, TCP and UDP us a port number.

  A port is an unsigned integer between 1 and 65,535.

  There are many standard ports. Telnet usually uses port 23 with the TCP protocol. DNS uses port 53, either with TCP or with UDP. FTP uses ports 21 and 20, one for commands, the other for data transfer. HTTP usually uses port 80, but it often uses ports 8000, 8080 and 8088, all with TCP.

<h3>Transmission Control Protocol</h3>

<!-- 
  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.

  It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP

  TCP provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.

  TCP is connection-oriented and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent.

  The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established.

  Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission and error-detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency.

  TCP employs network congestion avoidance.

<h3>Daytime and Echo Protocols</h3>

<!-- 
  The Daytime Protocol is a service in the Internet Protocol Suite.

  It is intended for testing and measurement purposes.

  A host may connect to a server that supports the Daytime Protocol on either TCP or UDP port 13.

  The server returns an ASCII character string of the current date and time in an unspecified format.

  The Echo Protocol is a service in the Internet Protocol Suite defined in RFC 862.
  
  It was originally proposed for testing and measurement of round-trip times in IP networks.

  A host may connect to a server that supports the Echo Protocol using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on the well-known port number 7.
  
  The server sends back an identical copy of the data it received.
