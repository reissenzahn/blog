<!-- 
  A skip list is a data structure that is used for storing a sorted list of items with the help of a hierarchy of linked lists that connect increasingly sparse subsequences of the items.

  It consists of a base list holding the elements, together with a tower of lists maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, each skipping over fewer elements.

  A skip list allows the process of item lookup in an efficiently manner.

  The skip list skips over many of the items of the full list in one step.

<!-- 
  A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows O(log n) search complexity as well as O(log n) insertion within an ordered sequence of n elements.

  It can get the best features of a sorted array (for searching) while maintaining a list-link structure that allows insertion.

  Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one.

  Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for.
  
  Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence.
  
  The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically or deterministically, with the former being more common.
-->

<!-- 
  A skip list is built in layers.

  The bottom layer is an ordinary ordered linked list.

  Each higher layer acts as an "express lane" for lists below where an element in layer i appears in layer i + 1 with some fixed probability (commonly 1/2 or 1/4).

  On average, each element appears in 1/(1-p) lists.

  A special head element at the front of the skip list appears in all the lists.

  The skip list contains log_{1/p) n lists.
