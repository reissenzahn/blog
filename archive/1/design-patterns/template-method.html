<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm as a set of steps in a superclass while deferring the implementation of some steps to subclasses. A subclass can also override steps of the algorithm without changing the algorithm structure. Optional steps called hooks allow subclasses to extend the algorithm at certain points.
</p>

<!--
  As you can see, we’ve got two types of steps:

  abstract steps must be implemented by every subclass
  optional steps already have some default implementation, but still can be overridden if needed

  There’s another type of step, called hooks. A hook is an optional step with an empty body. A template method would work even if a hook isn’t overridden. Usually, hooks are placed before and after crucial steps of algorithms, providing subclasses with additional extension points for an algorithm.

  Use the Template Method pattern when you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.

<ul>
  <li>
    An abstract class declares methods that act as steps of an algorithm as well as the template method which calls these methods in a specific order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The steps in the abstract class can either be declared as abstract or have a default implementation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Various concrete classes subclass the abstract class and can override steps as necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    The template method is declared as final to prevent it being overridden in concrete classes.
  </li>
</ul>
