<h3>Pod</h3>

<p>
  A Pod is a collection of one or more closely related containers sharing a network and mount namespace. The pod constitutes the basic unit of deployment so all containers in a pod are scheduled on the same node. The containers in a pod share the same IP address, port space and loopback network interface. As such, containers in the same pod can communicate with each other over localhost. However, the filesystem of each container is fully isolated from other containers.
</p>

<!--
  A pod is also the basic unit of scaling. Kubernetes can’t horizontally scale individual containers; instead, it scales whole pods.

  All pods in a Kubernetes cluster reside in a single flat, shared, network-address space, which means every pod can access every other pod at the other pod’s IP address.

  Pods are ephemeral—They may come and go at any time, whether it’s because a pod is removed from a node to make room for other pods, because someone scaled down the number of pods, or because a cluster node has failed.

  Kubernetes assigns an IP address to a pod after the pod has been scheduled to a node and before it’s started—Clients thus can’t know the IP address of the server pod up front.

<h3>ReplicationController</h3>

<p>
  A ReplicationController creates and manages replicas of pods. It ensures that a configured number of pods matches its label selector by creating or deleting pods as required. The pods are created according to a pod template. The replica count, label selector, and pod template can be modified at any time but only changes to the replica count affect existing pods. Changing the replica count enables easy horizontal scaling of pods.

<pre><code class="yaml"># rc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: clock

      containers:
      - name: clock
        image: dreissenzahn/clock:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash"># create replication controller
$ kubectl create -f rc.yaml

# edit definition
$ kubectl edit rc example

# list replication controllers
$ kubectl get rc

# describe replication controller
$ kubectl describe rc example

# list pods

# prompt creation of new pod

# delete replication controller
$ kubectl delete rc example

# delete replication controller but leave pods running
$ kubectl delete rc example --cascade=false

# delete all replication controllers
$ kubectl delete rc --all</code></pre>


<h3>ReplicaSet</h3>

<p>
  A ReplicaSet behaves exactly like a ReplicationController but it has more expressive pod selectors. ReplicaSets should be used instead of ReplicaControllers.

<pre><code class="yaml"># rs.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: clock
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: clock
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: clock
        image: dreissenzahn/clock:1.0.0</code></pre>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>

</p>

<!--
  A Service allows you to create a constant point of entry to a group of pods providing the same service.
  
  Each service has an IP address and port that never change while that service exists.
  
  Clients can open connections to that IP and port and those connections are then routed to one of the pods backing that service.
  
  A service can be backed by more than one pod. Connections to the service are load-balanced across all the backing pods.

  A label selector is used to define which pods are part of a service.
-->

<pre><code class="yaml"># svc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: clock</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash"># create service
$ kubectl create -f svc.yaml

# list services
$ kubectl get svc
</code></pre>



<h3>Deployments</h3>

<p>
  A Deployment allows for deploying applications and updating them declaratively. Pods
