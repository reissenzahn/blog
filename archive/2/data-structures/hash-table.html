<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  A hash table consists of an array of buckets that store key-value pairs. When inserting a key-value pair, a hash function is used to compute an index into the array of buckets and the value is stored in the corresponding bucket. Similarly, to lookup the value associated with a certain key, the hash function is used to compute the index of the appropriate bucket from which the corresponding value can be obtained.

<p>
  A hash collision occurs when a hash function generates the same index for more than one key. In such cases, a collision resolution strategy must be used.

  Common probe sequences include:

<ul>
  <li>
    Linear probing: interval between probes is fixed (usually 1).
  </li>
  <li>
    Quadratic probing: interval between probes is increased by adding the successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial to the original hash index.
  </li>
  <li>
    Double hashing: interval between probes is computed by a second hash function.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To ensure the integer output of a hash function is a valid index into the array of buckets it is typical to take the modulo of the integer and the length of array. However, in this case, every integer that shares a common factor with the length of the table will be mapped to an index that is a multiple of this factor. For instance, with length 15
