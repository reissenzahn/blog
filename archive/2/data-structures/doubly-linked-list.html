<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  A doubly linked list is a linked data structure consisting of a set of sequentially linked nodes. Traversal is possible in either direction. While inserting or removing a node requires changing more references than for a singly linked list, the operations are simpler and potentially more efficient because there is no need to keep track of the previous node during traversal.

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>

<p>
  A doubly linked list consists of a set of sequentially linked nodes. Each node contains a data field as well as two link fields that hold references to the next and previous nodes in the sequence. The first and last nodes (called the head and tail) are immediately accessible.

<h3 id="operations">Operations</h3>

<p>
  To insert the first node into the list simply both link fields of the new node must be set to NULL and that node must be made both the head and tail.

         | X |                     
NULL<----+---+{{% /code %}}

<p>
  Inserting a node after a given node involves setting the link fields of the new node appropriately while also updating the next and previously links of its new adjacent nodes. If the new node does not have a successive node then the new node must instead be made the tail. Inserting a new node before a given node is similar except that if the new node does not have a predecessor node then it must be made the head.
