<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class. This is achieved by wrapping the object in one or more decorator objects of the same type which add their own behavior before or after delegating to the decorated object. The pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
</p>

<!-- 

Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.

You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object.

Given that the decorator has the same supertype as the object it decorates, we can pass
around a decorated object in place of the original (wrapped) object.

The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after delegating to the object it
decorates to do the rest of the job.

 So here we’re using inheritance to achieve the type matching,
but we aren’t using inheritance to get behavior

ß Objects can be decorated at any time, so we can decorate objects dynamically at runtime
with as many decorators as we like.

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>Component</code> interface declares the common interface for the objects to be decorated and their decorators.
  </li>
  <li>
    A concrete <code>Component</code> implementation defines the basic behavior of the component which can be altered by decorators.
  </li>
  <li>
    The abstract <code>Decorator</code> class implements the <code>Component</code> interfaces so all decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.
  </li>
  <li>
    The abstract <code>Decorator</code> class maintains a references to the decorated object and forwards all method calls to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Concrete <code>Decorator</code> classes override the methods of the base decorator and execute additional behavior before or after calling the parent method.
  </li>
</ul>
