<!-- 
  The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

  The pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the actual owner of the state--called the originator object.

  The pattern suggests storing the copy of the object's state in a special object called memento.

  The contents of the memento are not accessible to any other object except the one that produced it.

  Other objects must communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot's metadata but not the original object's state contained in the snapshot.

  Such a restrictive policy lets you store mementos inside other objects, usually called caretakers. Since the caretaker works with the memento only via the limited interface, itâ€™s not able to tamper with the state stored inside the memento. At the same time, the originator has access to all fields inside the memento, allowing it to restore its previous state at will.

  Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

  Memento pattern captures object internal state making it easy to store and restore objects in any point of time.

  The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).
